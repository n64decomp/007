                         A hacking guide for Perfect Dark
                         Written by Krijy, Copyright 2005

                              Version 1.2 - 24.08.05

Perfect Dark, released in 2000, sported beautiful graphics and tons of replay
value. It was the evolution of GoldenEye, a game that revolutionised the first-
person-shooter genre, and built upon the same addictive and challenging
game play. At the time of writing this FAQ, it's been about five years since
Perfect Dark came out. The game has been played to death, and the sequel has
been forever in the making. In order to create more replay, and to bide the
time until Perfect Dark Zero is released, I have devised methods of modifying
and creating new level setups.

Have you ever wanted to play multiplayer games in solo arenas? What about
making new solo levels based on the already existing ones?

This FAQ will teach you how to mix and match parts of the levels in the game,
and in doing so create totally new levels!

                             Perfect Dark is forever

part. In the intro part I'll tell you about everything you need to know before
you start hacking any level modding codes. I'll describe Perfect Dark hacking

Perfect Dark level modding in general
_____________________________________

Perfect Dark level modding shouldn't be confused with PC game modding. Unlike
in PC first person shooters like Half-life, you can't totally create an
entirely new level from scratch. In Perfect Dark you are stuck to using the
same arenas that are already there (like Complex or the dataDyne Building). You
can however load stuff that is supposed to be in one level, in a different
level. Perfect Dark level modding consists of mix-matching objects and arenas
from all the levels in the game. The best way to describe this to you is for me
to give you an example. A great example that gives a totally new experience is
found by loading Pelagic II's solo mission in Villa's solo arena:

Pelagic II in Villa (Solo):
NTSC               PAL
8105D9B7 0021      8105D656 0021
8009DFE9 0021      8009E589 0021
81075582 0000      81075A52 0000
81074602 0000      81074AAA 0000
8107459A 0000      81074A42 0000
8107FFA0 0018      810804E0 0018
8107FFA2 016A      810804E2 016A
8107FFA4 0169      810804E4 0169
8108456A 003E      81084ABA 003E
8107B178 0100      8107B648 0100
8107B17A 0001      8107B64A 0001
8106FF42 EB40      810702D2 EED0
8107B858 036E      8107BD28 036E
8107D904 0DA8      8107DDD4 0DA8
8107D906 0266      8107DDD6 0266
8107D90C 3F12      8107DDDC 3F12
8107D90E A10D      8107DDDE A10D
81062C5A 0029      8106293A 0029
81062C5E 0029      8106293E 0029
81062C62 0029      81062942 0029
81062C66 0029      81062946 0029
80084023 000X      80084563 000X

This code will work a few seconds after the small Rareware logo at the bottom
of the screen turns up. The aim of the mission is to kill as many Maians as
possible! If you die simply press A a few times to restart. Don't press B at
the objectives menu. The only value that you can change is the one for the last
code on the list. This is the difficulty mod, so set this to 0 for Agent, 1 for
Special Agent and 2 for Perfect Agent (which is extremely hard).

As you can see, this code isn't exactly flawless. All the objects and guards
from Pelagic II have been placed in Villa (Solo). The cut-scenes haven't been
changed, and the objectives are a bit hard to do. On the upside the level is
functional, and poses a challenge.

Examples of more level modifiying codes can be found in the codes summary
section, including Crash Site in multiplayer, WAR! in Deep Sea and many others.


__________________________________

Formats and codes used in this FAQ
__________________________________

The way we are going to change Perfect Dark is through cheating device codes
that manipulate the temporary memory of the N64. The N64's temporary memory, or
RAM as it's commonly called, is where Perfect Dark stores all the data it's
currently using to keep the game running. Gameshark and Action Replay's change
the values seen in the RAM, thus changing certain things in the game. Cheating
devices are mainly used for trivial things like unlimited ammo, or
invincibility (codes for which Perfect Dark already has inbuilt). We're going
to be using cheating devices to do something much more cooler.

This FAQ is written with American Gamesharks (NTSC), European Action Replays /
Equalizers (PAL) and PC emulators in mind. Two PC emulators that support
cheating device codes are Nemu and Project64, but there may be others I'm
unaware of. When I show a code example I'll give both the NTSC version and PAL
version. That means that whether you live in America or in Europe, you won't
have any problems. I won't give examples for the Japanese version of Perfect
Dark, but all the methods of hacking I show in this FAQ can be applied for that
version too. If the NTSC and PAL version of the example I give work in both a
cheating device and emulator, then I won't give any PC version of the example.
If however the code is different between the two formats, I'll give both
cheating device versions and both emulator versions. Remember that an emulator
is only emulating Perfect Dark. This means that it might be emulating some
parts of the game wrong, or emulating some parts over precisely. Cheating
devices on the other hand might be doing stuff behind your back without you
realising it. My point is that both formats commute with Perfect Dark
differently, sometimes ending in slightly different codes. You won't have to
worry about this too much, because you won't be making very many codes that
differ between PC emulator and cheating device.

If you have the NTSC version of Perfect Dark you should be aware that there are
two versions! Version 1.0 and version 1.1. It's easy to tell which version you
have if it's a rom, just load it into Project 64 and the name it gives the rom
should have either 1.0 or 1.1 in it. If you have the game cartridge it's harder
to tell which version you have. The fully working multiplayer level codes
differ between version 1.0 and 1.1. On such code is Carrington Villa in
multiplayer (which can be found in the Codes section). You will find six
different versions of the enabler that gets Carrington Villa in multi working.
The easiest way to find out which version of Perfect Dark you have is to test
either one of the NTSC Gameshark enablers together with either Carrington Villa
Residence or Rooftop.

Before I go any further I must point out that I've never had any problems with
Perfect Dark level modding, when it comes to wear and tear on my cheating
device. The codes I provide in this FAQ should not blow your Gameshark up,
break it, or cause it to burn a hole right through to the centre of the earth.
The cheating devices for the Nintendo 64 are flimsy things, and break easily.
The best way to avoid damaging your cheating device is to treat it like you
would a fragile invaluable treasure. Turning the N64 off before removing the
cartridge is also recommended. Don't put any strong magnets near it, or mobile
phones that might cause disturbances. If your cheating device does happen to
die (which it won't), don't come whining to me.

Note to cheating device users:
------------------------------
Some of the codes in this FAQ can get quite long. While activating and
deactiving these codes in the codes menu of your cheating device, you may
sometimes confuse it. When your cheating device gets confused it will still
think the last code you activated is on. Any new codes that you may have
activated won't be on. This problem can be solved by unselecting all the codes
in the Perfect Dark codelist, and starting the game with no codes on. Once the
game starts you can turn it off and restart it. Any codes that you activate
next will work.

There are different types of cheating device codes. The mains ones that are at
your disposal are:

80XXXXXX 00VV - Normal 8bit code that changes a set of double digits.

81XXXXXX VVVV - 16bit code that changes two sets of double digits. The address
                has to end in an even number.

D0XXXXXX 00VV - 8bit activator. When the value at the address of the first line
8XXXXXXX VVVV   is the same as the value specified in the code, the second line
                is activated. This type of code is usually used together with
                buttons. When you press a button, the second line will be
                activated.

D1XXXXXX VVVV - 16bit version of activator.
8XXXXXXX VVVV

89XXXXXX VVVV - Cheating device button activator. When the button is pressed
                the code is activated.

Some codes in this FAQ require a one player push-button activator. This
activator is:
NTSC               PAL
D109C7E4 XXXX      D1099FB0 XXXX

XX can be:
0000 - No Buttons
0100 - D-Pad Right
0200 - D-Pad Lefft
0400 - D-Pad Down
0800 - D-Pad Up
1000 - Start
2000 - Z
4000 - B
8000 - A
0001 - C-Right
0002 - C-Lefft
0004 - C-Down
0008 - C-Up
0010 - R
0020 - L
0030 - L+R

You can combine the values to create different button sequences, like 0030 for
L + R, or 8422 for A + D-down + L + C-left.

The memory editor might look a bit alien if you don't know what you're looking
for. To make things a bit easier to understand I'll explain some of the types
of numbers that are easily recognisable. In the table below you can see the
address (both NTSC and PAL), and the values at those addresses.
         _____________________________________________________________
        |  NTSC                                                 PAL   |
        |8007FEB0 - 2300 0000 345E 0000 756C 6567 0000 0000 - 800803F0|
        |8007FEC0 - 3E19 999A 0000 0000 3F80 0000 8007 FEB0 - 80080400|
        |_____________________________________________________________|

On the first line, the very first value "23" is an 8bit value. The next value
along is "345E". This is a 16bit value. The actual value line is split up into
16bit value sections. 16bit values always start on even numbered addresses. The
next value is "756C6567". This is a 32bit value. 32bit values always start on
either 0, 4, 8 or C. On the second line you'll see a 32bit floating point
value. These can either be positive or negative depending on the first value.
If the value is 3 or 4 it's positive, and if it's B or C it's negative. The
next value is also a floating point value. "3F800000" is the floating point
value of 1. Likewise, "BF800000" is -1. The last value "8007FEB0" is a pointer.
It points towards an address in the memory, and in this example is pointing
towards the start of the first line. You might already know all this and take
it for granted, but if you're a beginner it's invaluable information.

Perfect Dark Hacking
____________________

For those that may have tried before, Perfect Dark can be somewhat difficult to
hack. The problem with Perfect Dark is that it uses the N64 RAM Expansion Pak.
Perfect Dark can be loaded in two different settings, either without an
Expansion Pak (Lo-resolution or lorez for short), or with an Expansion Pak
(Hi-resolution or hirez for short). In lorez you can only play in multiplayer,
and with a maximum of two players (played in tiny screens). In hirez you get
access to the entire game. The Expansion Pak adds an additional 4MB of RAM onto
the already existing 4MB, making it 8MB in total. All N64 cheating devices use
part of the additional RAM in order to get their code generators working. What
this means for Perfect Dark is that you can hack the game easily in lorez, but
you can't hack the game in hirez!

I've spent a considerable amount of time investigating how to get around the
problem of hacking Perfect Dark in hirez. At first it was a seemingly
impossible task, but using various methods, I (and other hackers) have
conceived ways of getting around this problem. To hack Perfect Dark in hirez
you are either going to need just a PC, or a Gameshark or Action Replay
Professional version 3.3 with a PC link cable. You DON'T necessarily have to
have a good PC. If you have neither of these then DON'T PANIC! It's entirely
possible to hack level modifying codes with just a normal Gameshark or Action
Replay / Equalizer version 3.0 cheating device.

Being able to "hack" in hirez won't be a necessity in hacking Perfect Dark
level mods. When I mention "hack" I mean being able to do search's, comparing
and other kinds of stuff. As an example, to "hack" could mean doing a less than
last / greater than last search in order to find an ammo modifier. I've done
most of the "hacking" already, so you shouldn't have to do any hirez hacking.
At most all you'll need to do is look at the memory editor (RAM). That's all.
There won't be any long searching for this code, or comparing for that code.
All of the codes will be made by looking at the memory and making codes that
correspond to different addresses.

For one or two codes in this FAQ you will have to be able to hack in hirez. You
can use the memory editor provided by the in-built code generator to hack most
of the codes seen in this FAQ, but you probably won't even have to use that.
I've already hacked most of the codes so all you need to do is write them down
and run them, without ever having to do much hacking yourself.

I'm going to explain how to hack Perfect Dark using three different methods.
The first is with just a version 3.0 cheating device. The second is with a
version 3.3 cheating device and with a PC link cable. The third is with just a
PC, using emulators and other programs.


__________________________________________

Hacking with a version 3.0 cheating device
__________________________________________

The only way to hack Perfect Dark with a version 3.0 cheating device is by
using the in-built code generator. You'll only be able to run the game in lorez
mode while hacking, so you're pretty limited. I won't go into detail about how
to use the code generator. The most important part is the memory editor, which
will allow you to change values that are in the memory.

To get Perfect Dark working with a version 3.0 cheating device you need to
first load the cheating device up with a game that uses the factory default
keycode (this could be Super Mario 64 or GoldenEye). At the menu select
keycodes and choose the Zelda keycode. Choose a keycode you don't have the game
for and you're screwed, so be careful and don't rush your way through this menu
and make a fatal mistake (like I once did). Once the Zelda keycode is
activated, turn off your N64 and put Perfect Dark in.

To play in hirez you need a 50 line long enable code. The following code must
be on at all times in hirez:
NTSC AND PAL
F1000204 27BD
F1000206 FFE4
F1000208 AFA8
F100020A 0014
F100020C AFA9
F100020E 0018
F1000210 3C1A
F1000212 A075
F1000214 375A
F1000216 C000
F1000218 3C08
F100021A A07C
F100021C 3508
F100021E 5C00
F1000220 241B
F1000222 0180
F1000224 8D09
F1000226 0000
F1000228 237B
F100022A FFFF
F100022C AF49
F100022E 0000
F1000230 2108
F1000232 0004
F1000234 1F60
F1000236 FFFB
F1000238 235A
F100023A 0004
F100023C 8FA9
F100023E 0018
F1000240 8FA8
F1000242 0014
F1000244 27BD
F1000246 001C
F1000248 3C1A
F100024A A075
F100024C 375A
F100024E C000
F1000250 0340
F1000252 0008
F1000254 0000
F1000256 0000
81000204 3C1A
81000206 A075
81000208 375A
8100020A C000
8100020C 0340
8100020E 0008
81000210 0000
81000212 0000

With this code on you'll be able to access most of the solo levels. Some levels
won't work because they come into conflict with the enabler. The levels that
won't work are the solo mission that takes place in Carrington Villa, and Area
51 Infiltration. Additionally, the multiplayer level Skedar will freeze
sometimes depending on where you start.

The total amount of codes that you can active with a version 3.0 cheating
device is about 128. Subtract the 50 line long enabler from that and you're
left with 78. If you try to activate more than 78 lines of code in hirez the
game will freeze. You don't need to have the enable code on in lorez.

Even though you can only hack the game in lorez, you can gain access to the
Perfect Menu with the cheat shown below. From the Perfect Menu you should be
able to load any multiplayer level or solo level with the help of level mods.
Solo levels are best loaded from the Cinema menu.

Change the Small but Perfect Menu into the Perfect Menu:
NTSC               PAL
8107529A 5674      8107575E 5674
8107529E 39D0      81075762 3DB4
810752A2 69C0      81075766 72B8

When you want to make multiplayer level mods, all of the normal multiplayer
levels can be mixed and matched, but only a few of the solo arenas will work in
lorez. The solo arenas that will work in lorez are:

Crash Site
Chicago
G5 Building (Solo)
Carrington Institute
Air Base
Skedar Ruins
Investigation

Any other solo arenas that aren't listed here won't work in lorez due to them
being too large.


____________________________________________________________

Hacking with a version 3.3 cheating device and PC link cable
____________________________________________________________

Hacking with a version 3.3 cheating device is quite similar to hacking with a
version 3.0, the difference is that you can connect the version 3.3 up to a
computer via a PC link cable. If you don't have a PC link cable then you can
only hack in lorez with the in-built code generator. Other than that, the
version 3.3 Gameshark / Action Replay is a lot better and easier to use than
the version 3.0. Getting Perfect Dark to work with a version 3.3 cheating
device works exactly the same way as getting PD to work with a version 3.0, so
look in the section above to find out how to get the game up and running.

There are some Gamesharks Pros / Action Replay Pros version 3.3 that the PC
link cable won't work with. Datel released a bunch of dud cheating devices with
parts missing from them. It's easy to tell if you've got a dud cheating device.
If the LED is missing (little white box in the front on the inside) and you see
no numbers when you turn your cheating device on it's a dud (we hate you for
this Datel). If you're buying a new cheating device make sure it has an LED.
Your best bet is to buy a Gameshark Pro version 3.2. There aren't any duds of
this version and it can be upgraded to a 3.3 (providing you don't have Windows
XP Service Pack 2). A Gameshark Pro version 3.2 will also work in a PAL N64, so
if you're a PAL user get one of these if you can't find anything else.

Two differences between the 3.0 and 3.3 version when it comes to Perfect Dark
is first the hirez enabler code, and secondly the amount of codes you can
activate. Instead of having to use a 50 line long hirez enable code you simply
need just one code. This code always starts with the value FF, which means it
defines were in the memory the cheating device is going to store the data for
the codes you've activated. You want to put this data in a part of the memory
that Perfect Dark doesn't use. Finding a place to put this data is as easy as
finding somewhere with lots of zeros. The next problem is finding out which
levels put their data where. You need a spot of zeros which none of the levels
put their data at. This can sometimes be rather tricky. The 50 line long
enabler puts the codes you've activated in the same spot where Villa (Solo) and
Infiltration puts level data (which is why the game crashes when you try to
load one of these levels). I'm telling you all this because the official hirez
enablers from Datel don't always get the job done. You may have to make your
own enabler code that will work for a specific level.

There are three enablers that can be found on the internet, but I'll only list
two of them here and tell you their faults. You can only have one hirez enabler
on at a time. The following investigations have been made by me with a PAL
cheating device.

Hirez Enabler 1:
NTSC AND PAL
FF000220 0000

This enabler will allow you to play every single level in the game. It's fully
compatible with all the levels but has a fatal flaw. You can only activate 10
lines of code with this enabler on. Some level modifying codes require you to
activate more than just 10 lines of code.

Hirez Enabler 2:
NTSC AND PAL
FF75C000 0000

This enabler will allow you to activate up to the maximum number of lines of
code possible (+-250 lines). Unfortunately, it has the same compatibility as
the 50 line long version 3.0 hirez enabler. You can't play in Villa (Solo) or
Infiltration with this enabler on.

Since these two enablers don't allow you to play in some levels, I made my own
enabler. The following enabler should allow you to play in all levels, and
activate up to +-250 lines of code.

Krijy's Hirez Enabler:
NTSC               PAL
FF72C5A0 0000      FF730000 0000

If for some reason you find a level that doesn't work with an enabler, and want
to make your own Perfect Dark hirez enabler, than a place to look for zeroes is
80700000 to 80750000. The zeroes in this area of the memory seldom get written to.

If you have problems with loading Perfect Dark in lorez then the following code
should help:

Lorez Enabler:
NTSC AND PAL
EE000000 0000

If you have a PC link cable, you can hack Perfect Dark with the help of some
useful programs on your PC. One thing you may want to note about a PC link
before you use it is that it sometimes plays around with the cheating device.
If you use the PC link, and then turn off you N64 and try to start it again,
the cheating device might not start. This can be solved by plugging in the PC
link again. Another annoying thing when using a PC link is that you may have to
pull the cheating device out of the N64, and wait for a few seconds before it
works again.

Once you've got a PC link connected up you have to download a few helpful
programs from the internet:

Official N64 Gameshark Utilities (and patch):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the official Gameshark hacking utility that's meant to be used together
with the PC link cable. It has several functions, like being able to hack
games, upload and download codelists, take screenshots and upgrade your
cheating device. Unfortunately, you can't hack Perfect Dark in hirez with it
(but you can when you use Perfect Trainer, which I'll get back to shortly). If
you have a cheating device with the normal Gameshark rom in it, the program
won't be able to detect Perfect Dark in hirez mode. You can hack in lorez, but
then again you might as well be using the in-built code generator. Other than
that, the hacking part of the official utils allows you to do searches for
values in a specific range. Using the hacking tools takes a painstakingly long
time, even more so than just using the code generator.

Where the official utils come in handy is the codelist abilities and the
ability to upgrade. You can download the current codelist (which is all the
codes on your cheating device), into a text file. This text file can be easily
modified. It won't have a file extension so you'll have to open it in notepad.
Once you've modified it and added all the codes you want, you have to use the
compile function to compile the codes. Once the codes have been compiled, press
upload to upload them to your cheating device. You don't have to go through the
strenuous job of adding codes the normal way. Some of the codes in this FAQ are
quite long, and using the update codelist method is the easiest way to add them
to your codelist.

The upgrade utility primarily allows you to upgrade your version 3.2 cheating
device to a version 3.3. The official utils only accept the official upgrade
rom, but by using the patch you can patch the program to accept other roms. The
rom the utils use in the upgrade is the file called "ar3.enc".

Note to PAL users:
------------------
The Official N64 Gameshark utils will work with Action Replays, but as the name
states, they are "Gameshark" utils and meant to be used together with the NTSC
format. You shouldn't have any problems at all using the utils, that is until
you upgrade the cheating device rom. When you upgrade it you will end up with a
Gameshark, and not an Action Replay. There really isn't much difference, but if
you choose to upgrade your codelist you'll end up with codes for the NTSC
version of N64 games. ALWAYS download a version of your PAL codelist before
upgrading, and don't choose to upgrade your codelist in any way when you
upgrade. That was only the minor difference. The greater difference is that
once you've upgraded to a Gameshark, your cheating device will run in 60hz mode
instead of 50hz! Most TV's support 60hz mode, but if yours doesn't you won't be
able to see much in the menus. Once you've entered a game it'll switch back to
50hz mode, so no worries there.

Note to Windows NT / 2000 or XP users:
--------------------------------------
The Official tools won't work by themselves. For security reasons the parallel
port used by the link cable will be disabled! You need to use another program
to get it working with the utils:

Perfect Trainer:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Perfect Trainer has been made by Icemario. It isn't a program, it's a cheating
device rom. Once you've got the Official N64 Gameshark utils, and used the
patch, you should be able to upgrade your cheating device with Perfect Trainer
(it uses the Zelda keycode as default, so you won't have to keep swapping
games). It allows the computer to be able to detect Perfect Dark while it runs
in hirez. This means that when you've got Perfect Trainer installed, you will
be able to hack Perfect Dark in hirez by using the hacking part of the Official
Utilities. Perfect Trainer allows you to run Perfect Dark in hirez, but you
can't really do more than that, and you can't activate any codes. Any codes you
make have to be activated through a program on your PC. When you want to play
with the codes you've created you need to upgrade your cheating device back to
a Gameshark. To upgrade your cheating device to Perfect Trainer, first make a
copy of the original "ar3.enc" file. Then take the "ar3.enc" file you get with
Perfect Trainer and swap it with the original in the Official N64 Utils folder.
Use the upgrade utility in the N64 Utils program to upgrade to Perfect Trainer.
When it comes to level modding, Perfect Trainer is best used together with the
Game Software Code Creator program.


Game Software Code Creator:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program allows you to hack games much in the same way the Official N64
utils do. The most important part is that you can use the RAM editor, which
will allow you to change values in the memory. Once you've installed Perfect
Trainer you can access all 8MB of the memory. Codes can be a bit hard to
activate, so you usually have to do them manually.

Game Software Code Creator has a few extra options, none of which are really
much useful other than one. The dump rom image button dumps a rom image of
whichever N64 game you've loaded into your N64. The process can take a while
depending on how big the rom is, and the format dumped in is "bin".

Note to Windows NT / 2000 or XP users:
--------------------------------------
GSCC won't work by ifself. For security reasons the parallel port used by the
link cable will be disabled! You need to use a driver called TotalIO to get it
working:

TotalIO:

I have tested TotalIO with GSCC and it definately works with Windows XP
Service Pack 2.

Hacking with emulators on a PC
______________________________

Hacking Perfect Dark with a PC is the best way to hack in hirez. To get Perfect
Dark running on a PC you need an emulator, and a rom image of Perfect Dark.
Perfect Dark runs smoothly on most high end computers, if you mean to actually
play the game on your PC. The game doesn't need to run smoothly in order for
you to hack level modifier codes. As long as you can navigate through the
menu's and move around levels, you can get away with having a pretty crap
computer. You'll be doing most of the playing by using your cheating device.

There are quite a few different emulators out there that run Perfect Dark, but
I'm going to focus mainly on Project 64 and Nemu. I've found Project 64 to be
the best emulator for Perfect Dark because it runs the game most accurately,
and has an easy to use cheat code system. Nemu has some advanced hacking tools,
and also allows you to use cheating device codes. The problem with Nemu is that
it's hard to get PD running on it, and the way you enter cheating device codes
is a complete bitch when it comes to codes longer than one line. Generally
speaking, you want to use Project 64 to hack and test cheats, and Nemu to help
you look at values in the memory.

The fabled N64 ROM's could be found by searching the internet, or they might be
found by using a P2P program. Neither of which is certain to give good results.

I don't know the law in the country you're in, but in most countries as long as
you own the original N64 game you're allowed to keep a copy of it. You'll be
using the codes you make here to use with a cheating device, and your copy of
the original Perfect Dark, in your N64. As mentioned in above, you can dump
roms with Game Software Code Creator. Dumping PD with GSCC is beyond doubt the
best rom copy that you can get, because it's a true copy of your Perfect Dark
cartridge. One problem with making your own copies is that the bin files don't
seem to run in Nemu. They will work fine in Project 64.

If you have any problems getting Perfect Dark to run in Project 64 on your PC,
you probably need to use a different plugin than the one provided. Plugins can
be found at zophar.net

Project 64 Homepage:
http://www.pj64.net

Nemu Homepage:
http://www.nemu.com

Zophar.net:
http://www.zophar.net


Viewing the N64 RAM memory on a PC:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In Nemu it's simple to view the memory. Go to the plugins menu and select
Debugger: Memory. A memory editor will pop up. You can navigate around by
putting an address in the top left corner. Press Search to search for values.
If you simply want to look at the memory editor any time during the game, Nemu
is the fastest way to find what you're looking for.

In Project 64 it's a bit harder to view the memory because there is no built in
function to do this. To view the memory you have to look at savestates.
Savestates are essentially snapshots of the memory taken at any time during
game play. When you load a savestate you start off exactly from where you saved
the savestate. Since savestates are snapshots of the memory they are 8Mb in
size, the same size as the RAM. In order to view these savestates you need a
hex editor program. The hex editor program shows you the hex values in the
memory, just like when using the memory editor.

Project 64 saves savestates in its own ".pj" format. Before you can do anything
you need to change the pj savestate. The pj format adds code to the start of
the memory file, and it also byte flips the savestate. Byte flipping means that
every byte is swapped around and jumbled up. When Project 64 runs a game it
byte flips the rom image before processing it. When you make a savestate the
memory remains byte flipped. To make the Project 64 savestate readable you need
to delete the part at the beginning of the file that has been added and byte
flip the file.

The best hex editor to use is Hex Workshop version 3 or better:
http://www.hexworkshop.com
http://www.bpsoft.com/downloads/index.html

To convert a Project 64 savestate to a more understandable form, open it in a
hex editor. Once you've done that you need to delete the first 75C (in hex)
8bit values. Highlight the beginning of the file and drag all the way down to
address 0000075C. Do not delete the value 00701A3C. Next you need to byte flip
the file. This can be done in Hex Workshop by going to the Tools menu, and then
the Operations menu. Select byte flip and set the settings at 32bit unsigned
and little endian type. Byte flip the entire file. You should now have a
correct savestate in the normal byte order and with the correct addresses. To
navigate the memory in Hex Workshop use the find and goto functions (ctrl+F)
and (ctrl+G).


Hacking by comparing savestates:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One way to hack Perfect Dark with a PC is by comparing savestates. Before you
can start comparing them they need to be correctly converted. Once you've byte
flipped and corrected the savestates you can use them in several different
hacking programs. In order to do a search for anything, you're going to need
lots of different savestates to compare. Some of the programs that you can use are:

Cheater64 v2.0 - for Project 64 savestates:
http://www.gscentral.com/lib/downloads/cheater64.zip

Savestate Cracker - for converted savestates:
http://www.geocities.com/hopperw2000/SSC/SSC.html
http://www.geocities.com/hopperw2000/SSC/SSC131.zip

VTR Compare 0.99 Beta - for Nemu savestates:
http://www.gscentral.com/lib/downloads/VTRCompare.zip

Comparing savestates from a game works much the same was as using hacking tools
and a PC link cable. The problem with both methods of hacking is that they take
absolutely ages. Doing one search usually takes an hour, if you're lucky, and
if you know more or less what you're looking for. While hacking by comparing
savestates can give you precise results, it takes too long and is a bit tedious.


Hacking during gameplay:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hacking during game play works in the same way as using the in-built code
generator in cheating devices. You don't have to worry about savestates, you
hack what you want while playing the game. This is done on a PC by using a game
hacking program on the emulator you're currently running the game in. The
specific program I want to mention is called ArtMoney.

ArtMoney:
http://www.artmoney.ru
http://www.artmoney.ru/artmoney708eng.exe

ArtMoney takes a little bit of work to get working, but once you've got it
working it's the best way of hacking Perfect Dark there is.

To get ArtMoney working, run it at the same time as the emulator is running,
and select the emulator from the select process menu. By default, ArtMoney will
search the entire memory of your computer. The exact amount depends on how much
RAM you have. When you run an emulator it uses 8Mb of your computers RAM. The
emulator always uses the same 8Mb of RAM, so you have to set ArtMoney to search
in just the 8Mb of RAM somewhere in your total RAM. Where the N64 RAM is put
varies between different computers.

In order to find where in your total RAM the emulator puts the N64 RAM, you
need to do a search for a simple code. Go to multiplayer and start a single
player game. Pick up a Falcon 2 because you're going to make an ammo mod. You
start with 8 bullets so do an exact search for the value 8. You'll want to set
the search type to integer 1 byte (whole numbers). Go back to the game, fire a
bullet and do a sieve for 7. Repeat the process until you have 2 results left.
Move them over to the list on the right and freeze the first one of them. Your
Falcon 2 should have infinite ammo (no reloads). On my PC the address this code
was at was 3D2477D8.

The next thing you want to do is find out the cheating device version of this
code. The address 3D2477D8 is within the 8Mb of RAM (from you total RAM) used
for Perfect Dark via the emulator. With ArtMoney still running, pause the game
and make a savestate. This savestate will have exactly the same values that
ArtMoney is looking at. Open the savestate and delete the pj intro part (up to
75C). DO NOT byte flip the file. The emulator you are using is running the game
with the RAM byte flipped. When you use ArtMoneys in-built memory editor,
you're looking at the byte flipped version of the memory! In ArtMoney,
right-click the infinite ammo Falcon 2 code and choose memory editor. You want
to find the exact same spot in the hex editor as the spot you are viewing with
ArtMoneys memory editor. In ArtMoneys memory editor find a long string of
values and do a search for them in the hex editor. In my case I did a search
for CA60823C and ended up around 001B77EC. The infinite ammo code was at
address 001B77D8, which is the byte flipped cheating device version.

You should now have two addresses, the ArtMoney address and the byte flipped
cheating device address. I had 3D2477D8 and 001B77D8. By chopping these two
codes in two you'll see that the last four digits are the same. 3D24 is equal
to 001B. By taking 3D24 and subtracting 001B you get 3D09. 3D09 equals 0000 and
is the start of the N64's RAM. 3D09 + 80 = 3D89, giving you the end of the
N64's RAM. Go to the options menu, and then the general menu. Select "Search in
address range" and input the address that equals the start of the N64 RAM, and
the end of it. For me it was 3D090000 to 3D890000. Once you've done this
ArtMoney will only look for codes in the N64 RAM, and not any other programs
you may be running on your PC.

Changing a byte flipped cheating device address into a correct cheating device
code is as easy as changing the last digit in the address. Based on converting
a byte flipped address to a correct address, use the following table to change
the last digit:
                  ___________________________________________
                  |                                         |
                  | 0 to 3     4 to 7     8 to B     C to F |
                  | 1 to 2     5 to 6     9 to A     D to E |
                  | 2 to 1     6 to 5     A to 9     E to D |
                  | 3 to 0     7 to 4     B to 8     F to C |
                  |_________________________________________|

The byte flipped code 001B77D8 is converted to 001B77DB, and finally
801B77DB 00XX.

To give an example of how easy it can be to change an ArtMoney address into a
cheating device code, I'll change the second code that I got while searching
for Falcon 2 infinite ammo.

 > The address I got was 3D247D4B.
 > First divide the address in two, 3D24 and 7D4B.
 > 3D24 - 3D09 (start of RAM) = 001B ==> 801B
 > 7D4B converted ==> 7D48
 > Final code is 801B7D48.

ArtMoney has one or two minor problems. First is the rate at which the values
of the codes are written to the RAM. When you freeze a value, you don't
actually freeze it. The value gets continually written to the RAM. To give an
example, activate just the second code obtained by searching for infinite ammo,
and set it to 2. This code tries to freeze the ammo bar on the right-hand side
of the screen into a 2 bullets left position. Reload and you will see the ammo
bar blinking, it's trying to become 8, but keeps getting told its supposed to
be 2 instead. Turn the code off in ArtMoney, convert it, and enter it into the
code section of the emulator you are using. When you activate it you'll notice
that the ammo bar is flashing a lot more rapidly. 2 is getting written to the
address a lot more often. This problem can be solved by setting the freeze time
to 1 in the additional options menu.

The second problem is the amount of results that you get while doing searches
for values you don't know. You're going to get a lot more than normal. Most of
these extra results are constantly changing values that like to be both equal
to last and different to last at the same time. Search a few more times than
normal and you should get rid of them. Another problem with doing equal and
different to searches is that sometimes you will end up with a long section of
code that you can't get rid of. This code is usually the addresses of the
textures on a character onscreen.

ArtMoney can be hard to get working, and it does have some problems with
getting codes working. On the upside you can easily port an ArtMoney address to
a cheating device address, and hacking codes with ArtMoney is the fastest way
there is to hack Perfect Dark in hirez.

The special part of this FAQ describes all about the hacking process. It's
divided into three main parts. The level modifier part teaches you how to make
the first part of a level modding code. The modifying the objects in a level
part explains how to change the objects, weapons and guards in a level. It also
explains how to move players into a level, when they start outside of it.
Advanced level modding describes how to make a fully working multiplayer level.

Two important keywords you may want to note the difference between are:

"Level" which describes the entire level, the arena, the players and the
        objects. The two types of level are a multiplayer level and a solo
        level (solo mission).
"Arena" which describes the actual place the level takes place in. An example
        is the Carrington Institute arena which is used in both the CI Training
        Ground and Defense. An arena consists of background (walls and floors),
        and collision detection (so that a player knows where the walls are).

An integral part of making new level setups is the level modifier. When I
mention level modifier, I don't just mean a code that changes which level has
been loaded. The level modifier codes that I am going to teach you to make,
allow you to change the files that build up the levels themselves. Before I go
into depth about this, I want you to try two examples. One is a multiplayer
level, whilst the other is a solo level.

Complex is Chicago:
NTSC               PAL
8107FF30 000A      81080470 000A
8107FF32 017C      81080472 017C
8107FF34 017B      81080474 017B

As you may have guessed from the name, this three lined code turns Complex into
Chicago. Simply start any type of multiplayer game in Complex to get it
working. You'll notice that most items are in undesirable places, but other
than that everything is working fine.

Air Force One is in Crash Site:
NTSC               PAL
81080320 0009      81080860 0009
81080322 0156      81080862 0156
81080324 0155      81080864 0155

This code loads Air Force One: Anti-terrorism in Crash Site. To get it working
simply choose the Air Force One level from the solo missions menu. One thing
you'll notice with this code is that the intro cut-scene takes place in the sky
above where the escape pod in Crash Site usually stands.

These two codes should give you an idea of what you can do with the level
modifier codes.


______________

The Level List
______________

All the levels in the game are on one list of values. The level list seen below
has both multiplayer levels, solo levels, and some other values that aren't
levels. These are the values used in what you would consider a normal level
modifier, a code that modifies which level is loaded. The two level modifiers
that we'll sometimes be using are the solo level mod and the multiplayer level mod.

Standard Solo Level Modifier:
NTSC              PAL
8009DFE9 00XX     8009E589 00XX

Standard Multiplayer Level Modifier:
NTSC              PAL
800ACB99 00XX     800AD139 00XX

Below you can see the level value, level type, level code and level name. There
are several different level types. Most are either solo levels or multiplayer
levels. Nothing means that there isn't any level there at all. Empty means that
there is a level there, but it's a BETA level that was never made. The level
codenames are the same ones as used in GoldenEye, hence the GoldenEye keywords
like azt or crad. Regardless of their codenames, Maian SOS (sev) has nothing to
do with Severnaya.

There are four known BETA levels. The first is Retaking the Institute. This was
supposed to take place in the Carrington Institute, and involved clearing the
building of enemy agents. It was never finished in time for the release of the
game. The second is a solo level set in the multiplayer arena called Skedar.
It's empty, and all it has is player one with some weapons and ammo. The third
also takes place in Skedar, but its setups have been deleted. At the E3 show in
1999, a brief four second video of a solo level taking place in Skedar was
shown. It involved running around shooting dataDyne shocktroopers and
Mr. Blonde's, with some Maian friends helping you. This level could be either
of the BETA solo levels that took place in Skedar (most likely the first one).
The fourth BETA level is the multiplayer level Rooftop. Since it doesn't have
any level text it's impossible to tell which value on the level list Rooftop
was originally meant to be at. There are 21 empty levels, including what was
originally Citadel in GoldenEye. There are also some remnants of GoldenEye
levels left in the game. These can't be used in any way, but you can see part
of certain briefings from GoldenEye in the memory editor.

All the levels on the level list are pre-built levels consisting of several
files. The level list is represented in the memory at:

NTSC 8007FCB0 to 80080A10 - PAL 800801F0 to 80080F50

It's the values on this list in the memory that you will be changing in order
to create new levels. Before I explain the different files that build up a
level, it's important to know where they come from. The files that build up a
level, and their values, can be found on the global object list.


______________________

The Global Object List
______________________

The Global Object List is not actually found in the memory during game play. By
using a hex editor on a ROM of Perfect Dark, you can find the actual names of
all the values on the list. In the memory you can find a list of pointers that
point to addresses in the ROM at NTSC 80082060 and PAL 800825A0. The global
object list contains every object asset used in the game. It has level files
used in levels, object files, costume files and weapon files. It also has some
unidentified files that are rumoured to be animation files and dialog files.
The entire list is 07DE in hex long, so I won't list the whole thing below. The
entire list can be found in the resources section at the bottom of this FAQ.
Some examples of the values on the global object list can be seen below:

You'll notice that a lot of these files don't have levels connected to them.
The reason is that the files are empty! There isn't any information in them.
Most of these empty values are used in the "empty" levels I mentioned earlier
on in the level list.


_______________________________

The files that build up a level
_______________________________

There are 5 main files that build up a level, 1 known file that has minimal
use, and 6 files that don't have any use. I'll take Chicago as an example. The
codename for Chicago is pete:

000A - bgdata/bg_pete.seg      - Background data (Wall and floor images)
017C - bgdata/bg_pete_tilesZ   - Collision detection (Contact with the bgdata)
017B - bgdata/bg_pete_padsZ    - Pads (preset positions)
013E - UsetuppeteZ             - Solo mission setup
011A - Ump_setuppeteZ          - Multiplayer setup (BETA GoldenEye Streets?)
06DC - LpeteE                  - Solo mission text
06DD - LpeteJ                  - Unknown / unused
06DE - LpeteP                  - Unknown / unused
06DF - Lpete_str_gZ            - Unknown / unused
06E0 - Lpete_str_fZ            - Unknown / unused
06E1 - Lpete_str_sZ            - Unknown / unused
06E2 - Lpete_str_iZ            - Unknown / unused

We are only going to be changing the first five of these values, the background
data, collision detection, setups and pads.

Bgdata:
-------
The background data is the file that contains information about the walls and
floors that you can see in a level. This file is closely related to the
collision detection file.

Tiles:
------
The tiles file is also known as the collision detection file. It contains
information that tells the player when they have walked into a wall, or are
standing on a floor. In addition it defines where there are ladders that you
can climb up. It has to be used at the same time as its corresponding
background data file. A background data and collision detection file used
together are known as an arena.

There are 31 different arenas. The 31st is the Default arena, which is used in
all the "empty" levels that have no distinctive walls or floors. The Default
arena is simply a big square floor, and was no doubt used as a testing area at
some point during the making of Perfect Dark. Some arenas are so big that they
are used in several different levels. Most notable are Area 51 and the dataDyne
Building.

Pads:
-----
The pads are positions defined in relation to the arena they are supposed to be
in. Think of a pad as a beer mat lying somewhere in an arena. On the beer mat
you put a pint of beer (an object). There are many different kinds of pads.
Some simply have coordinates that define a position, others define both
position and which direction the object put there is pointing in. Some door
pads reshape an object to fit a door, other pads might be hanging is midair.
The amount of pads vary from arena to arena, with Complex having only E2 pads,
and Area 51 having 568 (that's 1384 in decimal!). Pads should be loaded in the
arenas they are meant to be in, but that doesn't mean they're bound to that
arena. You could load the pads from Area 51 in Complex, but most of the pads
would be outside the arena or hanging in midair.

Solo setup and Mp_setup:
------------------------
The setup files put objects in the pads of the arenas they are meant to be
played in. The solo setup puts doors, enemies and objects in the pads of a solo
level. It also defines objectives and player one's status. Mp_setup files,
better known as multiplayer setup files, put ammocrates and weapons in pads.
They also put respawn points, bases and hills in pads. A base or hill will
highlight the room a pad is in (and put the case on that pad).

A lot of the "empty" setups have something in them. These can't be loaded or
used in any way, so I haven't found out much about them. To give an example, in
multiplayer levels like Sewers, its solo setup contains three lifts. Some of
the mp_setup files contain "remnants" of GoldenEye in them. If you try to load
them the game will freeze, but you will be able to see parts of their briefings.

L"codename"E:
-------------
This is solo mission text. You won't be changing this, but it's nice to know
it's there.


____________________

Changing level files
____________________

In order to change the levels, you simply need to swap their level files
around. Below you can see an example of what Chicago looks like represented in
the memory:
         _____________________________________________________________
        |  NTSC                                                 PAL   |
        |8007FEB0 - 0000 0000 3F80 0000 001D 02FF 6464 0000 - 800803F0|
        |8007FEC0 - 000A 017C 017B 013E 011A 0000 3F80 0000 - 80080400|
        |8007FED0 - 3F80 0000 42C8 0000 0000 00FF 0000 00FF - 80080410|
        |8007FEE0 - 3E19 999A FFFF 0190 0000 0000 3F80 0000 - 80080420|
        |_____________________________________________________________|

001D is the level value from the level list. The fist 16bit value on the second
line is the background data (000A). After that comes the collision detection
(017C), the pads (017B), the solo setup (013E) and the mp_setup (011A). In this
instance, since Chicago doesn't have a multiplayer setup, the value 011A is an
empty file.

To modify Chicago you simply need to change a few values (NTSC code example):
8107FEC0 00XX - Background data mod
8107FEC2 0XXX - Collision Detection mod
8107FEC4 0XXX - Pads mod
8107FEC6 0XXX - Solo setup mod
8107FEC8 0XXX - Multiplayer setup mod

I'll take another example, this one shows which files Extraction uses:
         _____________________________________________________________
        |  NTSC                                                 PAL   |
        |8007FFC0 - 3E19 999A FFFF 0190 0000 0000 3F80 0000 - 80080500|
        |8007FFD0 - 0022 02FF 6464 0000 001C 014C 0151 0129 - 80080510|
        |8007FFE0 - 0105 0000 3F80 0000 3F80 0000 42C8 0000 - 80080520|
        |8007FFF0 - 0000 00FF 0000 00FF 3E19 999A FFFF 0190 - 80080530|
        |_____________________________________________________________|

8107FFD8 00XX - Background data mod
8107FFDA 0XXX - Collision Detection mod
8107FFDC 0XXX - Pads mod
8107FFDE 0XXX - Solo setup mod
8107FFE0 0XXX - Multiplayer setup mod

Notice which background data and collision detection files are used here:
001C - bgdata/bg_ame.seg       - dataDyne Building
014C - bgdata/bg_ame_tilesZ    - dataDyne Building
0151 - bgdata/bg_ark_padsZ     - Extraction
0129 - UsetuparkZ              - Extraction
0105 - Ump_setuparkZ

"ame" is also the codename for Defection, but the bgdata and tiles are used in
Defection, Extraction and Mr.Blonde's Revenge. The bgdata and tile files with
codename "ark" (000F, 0152) are unused and empty files. Ump_setuparkZ is also
empty.


Level list files chart:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To make things easier to understand, I've made a list which shows the values
from all the levels on the level list, in the order that they are shown in the
memory (at NTSC 8007FCB0 to 80080A10 or PAL 800801F0 to 80080F50). The ones
with blank level names are levels that are empty and consist only of empty
files. The codename doesn't always apply for all bgdata and tiles, like Maian
SOS which uses Area 51's bgdata and tiles. The unknown BETA level 14 uses
Skedar's bgdata, tiles and pads, but the setup files are empty. The pads and
setups in Retaking the Institute are empty too, so there's nothing BETA to be
found there either.

Level list code charts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Normally, to find the level modifier code you want, you would have to track
down the level you want to change on the level list, represented in the memory
(at NTSC 8007FCB0 to 80080A10 or PAL 800801F0 to 80080F50). To make things a
lot easier I've compiled the following code lists in both NTSC and PAL. Use the
codes together with the values in the tables seen above.

NTSC Level List Codes:

Loading a level via the Combat Simulator menu
_____________________________________________

When loading a level via the combat simulator menu, you'll be loading levels in
multiplayer mode. Multiplayer mode more or less means that any players will be
the players chosen from the player menu's, the pause menu system will be like
that from multiplayer, and you can set lots of different things (like one-hit
kills, or fast motion). You probably know all this from before, but the reason
I'm telling you is because you can load a solo level via the Combat Simulator
menu.

Remember those two different setups mentioned earlier? When you load a level
via the Combat Simulator menu, the file set at the mp_setup slot will be
loaded. Multiplayer mode uses only four files, the bgdata, tiles, pads and
mp_setup. You can mix and match files from the original multiplayer levels
easily. To load solo levels, and levels that can't be selected from the level
menu, you have to use the standard multiplayer level mod:

800ACB99 00XX      800AD139 00XX

To select the modified level from the arena list, instead of always forcing the
game to play in the same level, use the following code. This code changes which
level is loaded when you choose Random from the arena menu:

NTSC               PAL
80084BF9 00XX      80085149 00XX


Example of mix matching original multiplayer levels (PAL example):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Villa Bgdata mod:   81080DA0 002C - Warehouse bgdata
Villa Tiles mod:    81080DA2 01F0 - Warehouse tiles
Villa Pads mod:     81080DA4 01EF - Warehouse pads
Villa Mp_setup mod: 81080DA8 01E2 - Base mp_setup

The codes change Villa, so to play in this level simply select Villa. You'll
notice that the actual level is Warehouse, with Warehouse's positions, but the
sky is Villa's. The mp_setup is Base's, so it has lots of metal crates, five
doors and two lifts. All of these objects are put in positions that correspond
to Base's pads. As a result, most of the objects are out of place.

Villa is Warehouse with Base's mp_setup:
NTSC               PAL
81080860 002C      81080DA0 002C
81080862 01F0      81080DA2 01F0
81080864 01EF      81080DA4 01EF
81080868 01E2      81080DA8 01E2


Example of a multiplayer game in a solo only arena:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is probably what you'll be doing most, making previously solo only arenas
playable in multiplayer. The problem with solo only levels is that they don't
have mp_setup files (or rather, they do have mp_setup files, but they're either
empty or GoldenEye leftovers). The solution is rather simple. Simply use an
mp_setup file from a multiplayer level that has a working mp_setup file.
Remember the "Complex is Chicago" code I showed you earlier?

NTSC               PAL
8107FF30 000A      81080470 000A - Complex bgdata mod
8107FF32 017C      81080472 017C - Complex tiles mod
8107FF34 017B      81080474 017B - Complex pads mod

All this code does is change the look and positions of Complex into Chicago.
Complexes mp_setup remains unchanged, so you play in Chicago with Complexes
mp_setup.

Base is the Carrington Institute with Skedar's mp_setup:
NTSC               PAL
810805C0 0013      81080B00 0013
810805C2 0166      81080B02 0166
810805C4 0165      81080B04 0165
810805C8 0118      81080B08 0118

This is a version of the Carrington Institute in multiplayer. It's a Base mod
so choose Base from the menu. It uses Skedar's mp_setup. The weapons can be
found in the hangar, and the ammo can be found in the firing range. If you use
other mp_setups the weapons and ammo will appear elsewhere. The following
mp_setups are the best ones to use:

011B - Complex
0118 - Skedar
010B - G5 Building (Mp)
0212 - Villa

If you remove the last code in the example above, Base's mp_setup will be
loaded. This mp_setup is great for the Carrington Institute because it has two
lifts in it.

In the example above you may have noticed that the level looks kind of flushed
out. That's because the shadowing is missing. This is most obvious in the
firing range, by looking at the walls along the left and right (they're usually
blacked out). If you look around you will actually see that some walls are
darker than others. These patches are actually Base's shadowing. The files that
build up a level aren't the only things connected to a level. There's also
shadowing, fog, backdrop and sky. The problem can easily be solved by loading
the Carrington Institute in a level it's meant to be loaded in:

The Carrington Institute (Defense version) in multiplayer with Base's setup:
NTSC               PAL
800ACB99 002D      800AD139 002D
81080210 0212      81080788 0212

The shadowing will work with this version of the code. The sky should also be
blue and sunny, and it takes less lines of code to achieve the same results.
The floor reflection in the main hall also works.


Example of a solo mission loaded in multiplayer:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Loading a solo mission via the Combat Simulator gives you a wealth of options
you can't choose from normally via the Solo Mission menu. The easiest way to
make this type of level mod is to simply swap the solo and mp_setup files
around, and don't change the background data or collision detection. You want
to have the shadowing loaded in the right level, or the game tends to freeze.

WAR! loaded via the Combat Simulator:
NTSC               PAL
800ACB99 0016      800AD139 0016
8107FD40 0148      81080280 0148

To get this seriously cool code working, simply press start at the Combat
Simulator Advanced menu. Don't be too hasty, there are a few things you have to
set before entering the level. First and foremost you'll want to turn on teams
and select Cyan. If you don't, the Maians at the start of the level will mince
you with their Callistoes (the Skedar's team colour is yellow). Secondly, you
won't be playing as a Maian soldier. You'll be playing as player one, so load
your own multiplayer player from the menu. Lastly you can set certain stuff
like slow-motion or fast movement.

Once the game starts, you'll take control of your player and probably feel
large because you usually play this level with a short Maian. The objectives
interface isn't activated, so you won't be getting any "Objective 1 Completed"
messages. If you die you'll respawn at the start of the level. By default the
game loads the level in Agent mode. Last but not least, the game will freeze
when it tries to load the level complete menu.

Level Difficulty Mod:
NTSC               PAL
80084023 000X      80084563 000X

Use this code to set the level difficulty. The values are:
00 - Agent (It's set at this by default)
01 - Special Agent
02 - Perfect Agent

Level Complete Fix:
NTSC               PAL
8009D08B 0001      8009D5EB 0001 - Agent
8009D08F 0001      8009D5EF 0001 - Special Agent
8009D013 0001      8009D5F3 0001 - Perfect Agent

Use this code to stop the game from freezing when the level is completed. If
you're playing in Agent mode then use the first code. If you're playing in
Special Agent mode then use the first and second code. For Perfect Agent mode
use all three codes. If the above code doesn't work, use this code instead:

Alternate Level Complete Fix:
NTSC               PAL
D1067E56 XX00      D1067B36 XX00
800AC7F6 0190      800ACD96 0190

This code contains the objectives complete modifier and the Briefcase score
modifier. To get it working you need to have Hold the Briefcase on as a
scenario, and Team Score must not be set to unlimited. The game ends the moment
you complete all the objectives, so you can't watch the outro cut-scene. The
objective values for WAR! are:

02 - Objective one complete (Agent)
06 - Objective one and two complete (Special Agent)
0E - Objective one, two and three complete (Perfect Agent)

Some solo missions have objectives that simply won't work when you load the
mission via the Combat Simulator menu. A good example is in Defense. The
buttons that activate the droneguns don't work. You simply can't press them, so
you can't activate them. When it comes to these kind of objectives, the best
thing to do is to hack individual codes that fix the problems. Since that can
be a hard and lengthy procedure, the second best thing to do is use the
objectives completed mod, and simply skip the objective.

Objectives completed (or failed) modifier:
NTSC               PAL
81067E56 XX00      81067B36 XX00

The values for the objectives completed mod vary depending on which level is
loaded, and how many objectives there are. If completing objective 1 had the
value 02, and completing objective 1 and 2 had the value 04, you could make
the following code:

D1067E56 0200
81067E56 0400

This code uses an activator. When objective 1 is complete, objective 1 and 2
will become complete.

Note of importance:
Depending on the compatibility of your cheating device, only certain levels
will work. It's well known that with a version 3.0 Gameshark or Action Replay,
you can't play in Villa (Solo) or Infiltration. The version 3.3 Professional
cheating devices have better compatibility. For the best compatibility use an
emulator on a PC. Not all levels can be loaded via the Combat Simulator menu
when using a version 3.0 cheating device. Of those levels that can be loaded
and work with version 3.0, stick to playing with only one player. WAR! is a
relatively easy level to load, and the example I've given above works in all
versions. If you try and add a second player (Co-operative mode) and have a
version 3.0, the game will freeze. If you have anything better than 3.0 then
two players should work fine. On a PC you can activate up to four players, for
Tri-operative and Quad-operative modes.


Tri-operative and Quad-operative modes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sounds exciting doesn't it? The ability to play solo levels with up to four
people. There are two problems with this. The first is that most levels won't
work, and the second is that the game lags. In normal co-operative mode the
game lags quite a bit, but add two more players and the enemies will be running
around you in circles before you even see them. To get Tri-operative or
Quad-operative modes working, simply follow the same procedure as loading a
solo mission via the Combat Simulator menu.

WAR! loaded via the Combat Simulator (Complete, Perfect Agent version):
NTSC               PAL
800ACB99 0016      800AD139 0016
8107FD40 0148      81080280 0148
80084023 0002      80084563 0002
8009D08B 0001      8009D5EB 0001
8009D08F 0001      8009D5EF 0001
8009D013 0001      8009D5F3 0001

The amount of players depends on how many have pressed start. Unfortunately,
player three and four are stuck inside each other, so you'll have to either
kill one of them, or move them (see Part 2).

Loading a level via the solo mission menu's
___________________________________________

Loading levels via the solo menu's really only allows you to play solo
missions. You can't load multiplayer setups or multiplayer games via the solo
mission menu's. The solo mission menu's are the one player Solo Mission menu,
Co-operative menu, Counter-operative menu and the Cinema menu. Loading a level
from the Cinema menu allows you to skip the solo mission briefing.

When you load a level via the solo mission menu's, the game uses 11 different
files. Four of these are the files that build up a level: bgdata, tiles, pads
and solo setup. The game loads the file set at the solo setup value. The
remaining 7 files are the level text and 6 other files that are connected to a
missions solo setup. You can't change these files (with the exception of the
text), so you can only load solo setups in the levels they are meant to be in.
You can't swap levels around so that, to give an example, you change Chicago
into Pelagic II. You can't do this because you can't change Chicago's other
solo mission files. This means that when using the solo mission menu's, you'll
only be able to change the bgdata, tiles and pads. Try and change anything else
and you risk the game freezing.

000A - bgdata/bg_pete.seg      - Background data (Wall and floor images)
017C - bgdata/bg_pete_tilesZ   - Collision detection (Contact with the bgdata)
017B - bgdata/bg_pete_padsZ    - Pads (preset positions)
013E - UsetuppeteZ             - Solo mission setup
06DC - LpeteE                  - Solo mission text
06DD - LpeteJ                  - Unknown / unused
06DE - LpeteP                  - Unknown / unused

Example of a solo mission in an arena it's not supposed to be in:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Putting a solo mission in an arena it's not supposed to be in can produce some
really cool solo levels. The process involves putting all the objects and
guards from a solo setup, into a different arena than normal. Not all
combinations work, and not all combinations are easy to get to work. Choosing
which setup to put in which arena defines what kind of level it will be like.
You can load WAR!s setup in almost any arena, giving you a solo mission that
involves respawning enemies and targets you have to kill. Alternatively, you
can load Crash Site's setup into most arenas, giving you a level with lots of
guards walking around. The following example loads Area 51's arena in Crash
Site. Select Crash Site from the solo mission menu to get it working.

Crash Site in Area 51:
NTSC               PAL
8107FE88 001B      810803C8 001B
8107FE8A 0176      810803CA 0176
8107FE8C 0175      810803CC 0175

The first thing you'll notice is the cut-scene. It takes place above the arena.
It does this because the cut-scene is taking place in the exact same place as
the cut-scene normally would in Crash Site's arena. Unfortunately you can't
change this, and you will start at exactly the same coordinates as normal. This
is usually outside the level, meaning that when the game starts, player one
falls to the ground and dies (in the example you fall down and land in the
level). This can be solved by either changing player ones coordinates
temporarily, or by moonjumping.

Other things you may notice is the sheer amount of objects in odd places, and
that some of the objectives have become unachievable. You will also see that
some of the attributes of the level have been transferred over. What I'm
talking about is like in the example, it's snowing everywhere, and some of the
rooms are shrouded in darkness like the caves from Crash Site. This can either
be for the better or worst.


Moonjump codes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to get around a level there are two ways. Both involve using
activators, which means having to press a button. The first way is by moving
player ones coordinates. I'll describe how to do this in Part 2. The second way
to get around, or to move player one into a level, is by moonjumping.
Moonjumping is perfect for when you want to test arena and setup combinations,
because you usually start outside the level. Simply press B to move upwards,
while you are falling. You have to find something to fall off, but you can
usually find a "hotspot" that allows you to moonjump from a flat floor.
Switching to controller style 1.1 makes things a lot easier to control. There
are four different moonjump codes. Which one you use is decided by the arena
you are in (with one or two exceptions). Most solo arenas use the first
moonjump code provided, Villa (Solo) and Infiltration differ (Maian SOS differs
too, but I can't remember which moonjump it uses). All multiplayer arenas use
the multiplayer moonjump. You can activate all four moonjump codes at the same
time without any side effects, so the easiest thing to do is just activate them
all.

Solo only arena Moonjump:
NTSC               PAL
D009C7E4 0040      D1099FB0 4000

The amount of pads in a level:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The amount of pads there is in a level has a lot to do with whether a setup can
be loaded in a different level or not. If the setup is trying to place an
object on a pad that doesn't exist, the game is likely to freeze. To give an
example, Complex has E2 pads and Area 51 has 568. The solo setup for Maian SOS
has lots of objects and guards it puts in 568 different places. Let's say that
the UFO is put at pad number 52E. When you load Maian SOS's setup in Complex
with Complexes pads, the UFO is still put at pad number 52E. Complex only has
E2 pads, pad number 52E doesn't exist! There's about an 80% chance that the
game will freeze. The more objects and guards that are put in pads that don't
exist, the higher this percentage becomes.

Does this mean that you can't load Maian SOS's setup in Complex? The answer
would be no. The setup for Maian SOS is incompatible with the pads from
Complex, but not with the pads from Area 51. You can load Complex with Area
51's pads, and Maian SOS's setup and it won't freeze. Consequently, none of the
pads from Area 51 are put in the same position as the arena Complex, so the
arena will be empty.

To make things easier to work out I've compiled the following list:

Number:  Level used in:          Total number of pads (in hex):

  0183     Maian SOS               568
  018D     WAR!                    152

  021B     Grid                    DA

Some pad files are identical to one another. Infiltration, Rescue, Escape and
Maian SOS all share Area 51's pads. Swapping the pads from Rescue with the ones
from Maian SOS won't change anything. The same goes for Defense, Duel and the
CI Training Ground. Retaking the Institute doesn't have any pads. Most of
Defections pads are different than Extractions pads. Mr. Blondes Revenge uses
Defections pads.


Loading solo levels via the Cinema menu:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some solo levels freeze at the objectives and briefing menu when you try to
load them. Other levels you may want to start after a mid-level cut-scene. This
can be done by loading the level via the Cinema menu. No briefings will be
shown, so the game won't freeze. In order to stop the game from ending the
level the moment you start you need the following code:

"Happening" Modifier:
NTSC               PAL
8009A493 000X      8009A9E3 000X

The "happening" modifier shows the value 0000 when the game wants something to
happen, and 0001 when it doesn't want anything to happen. Set it at 0000 and
the level won't end when the cut-scene finishes. Set it at 0001 and you can't
activate any of the cut-scenes.


Skipping the intro logo's and menu's:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you really can't get past the logo's without the game freezing, or you want
to test levels quickly, there is a way to skip the intro logo's. In truth, you
don't just skip the logo's and menu's, you skip everything else as well!
Loading levels like this is the best way to see if a combination of level files
will work or not, and it's also a lot easier than having to watch all the
logo's, and go through all the menu's before finally getting the chance to test
a level.

Go straight to a solo mission upon starting the game:
NTSC               PAL
8105D9B6 00XX      8105D656 00XX
8009DFE9 00XX      8009E589 00XX
81075582 0000      81075A52 0000
81074602 0000      81074AAA 0000
8107459A 0000      81074A42 0000

XX stands for a value from the level list. The other codes are menu modifiers
that stop you from selecting anything from the menu's that pop up. The only way
to freeze the game is by pressing B at the objectives menu when you restart.
You should be able to play the level over and over.


______________________

Other level attributes
______________________

The files that build up a level are not the only things that are connected to a
level. A level also has a sky, shadowing, fog, and if it's a solo level,
background music (lights are part of the background data, when loaded in solo).
You can't change these very easily, so if you want to make a level with a
specific sky or fog type, you have to modify that level. If you want to play
solo arenas in multiplayer, you need the shadowing for those levels as well. To
get this you have to modify the levels the solo arenas are originally used in.
Some levels allow you to see farther, and some levels reduce how far you can
see by blacking out walls in the distance. Levels with fog in like Crash Site
allow you to see far into the distance. One thing to note is that when you load
a level in solo mode, any backdrops will appear. What I mean as in backdrop is
the sun from the Carrington Institute, the planet from Attack Ship and the moon
from the dataDyne Building. These backdrops will disappear when you load the
level in multiplayer mode. When you make level mods for lorez you've got to
make sure you modify an already working level, and hope that that levels
shadowing doesn't mess things up.


Level Skies:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are different types of level skies. Multiplayer usually has a black sky
with coloured clouds, while solo usually has a nicer looking sky with a
backdrop. Some levels that are large have fog, but it isn't used as much as in
GoldenEye. One level to take note of is BETA level 2B, which has really heavy
fogging and you cant see farther than a few meters ahead of you.

What can the level skies tell us about the BETA levels? Most BETA levels have
black sky, but some have coloured skies, and even a little bit of shadowing and
fog. Some of the level skies look like they've been left over from GoldenEye.
Most notably is level 1A which has a cloudy sky and a waterline. In GoldenEye,
1A is Frigates level. The level 2B is the level that Surface 2 is in, and that
has heavy fog like the one in Perfect Dark has too. It's still hard to tell
which level was meant to be Rooftop, but it can't have been any of the BETA
levels with a black sky. Rooftop must have had a sky to look up at, because
like the name states, it takes place on a rooftop.

A simple music modifier for solo levels (like the one for multiplayer seen
above) does exist, but it doesn't work as expected. Solo levels have two
soundtracks, a foreground and background soundtrack (in addition to an X
soundtrack). The solo music modifier randomly selects which of the foreground
and background soundtracks to choose from. The result is that you sometimes end
up with two soundtracks playing at the same time. Instead of a code that
modifies the soundtrack played in all solo levels, you need to make codes that
work in single levels.

The solo level soundtrack list is located at NTSC 80084500 and PAL 80084A50. To
make things easier I've made a table which can be seen below:

  |__________________________________________________________________________|

In the first column of values you can see the level number. These numbers are
the same as the ones on the level list and don't need to be changed. The second
row holds the foreground soundtrack modifier (FG), and the third holds the
background soundtrack modifier (BG). The last row is the X soundtrack modifier.

The foreground soundtrack is the normal soundtrack you listen to. The
background soundtrack is the background effects that you can hear in most
levels. To give an example, it could be wind from levels like Skedar Ruins, or
traffic buzz from levels like Defection and Extraction. The X soundtrack is the
upbeat version of the normal foreground music. It's normally activated some
time during the level (it isn't activated in Investigation, Pelagic II or Crash
Site).

To make the code of your choice, simply use the table above to assign the
correct values to the correct address. To give an example, if you wanted to
make a code that changes Crash Sites foreground music into Alien Conflict, it
would be:

NTSC               PAL
81084562 0040      81084AB2 0040

Changing the soundtrack in a solo level goes a long way to changing the overall
feel of the level, and makes it feel more different than if you just let the
original soundtrack play.

Modifying objects
_________________

When you modify an object using the following codes, you modify all instances
of that object in the game. Wherever it appears in the game it will have been
changed. To give an example, if you were to change the metal crate image into a
UFO, you would get UFO's in Complex and Ravine (which both have metal crates).
These codes only allow you to change an objects image and size. The object
image is modified using the object image values on the global object list.

Below you will see two lists of codes, one for PAL and one for NTSC. This list
is taken from NTSC 8007B070 and PAL 8007B540, and builds up the in-game object
list (see the resources section). You will find codes that modify an objects
image next to that object, and it's image value from the global object list. To
make an object modification simply find the object you want to change, and the
object you want to change it to. Use the code from the object you want to
change, and the image value of the object you want to change it to (try not to
mix the PAL and NTSC lists up, they look identical). Here's an example:

Change Shield into BETA Body Armour:
NTSC               PAL
8107B810 0564      8107BCE0 0564

To modify an objects size, simply add 2 to the image modifier address. Most
objects have either 0199 or 1000 as their object size.

Make Shield (or the object it has been turned into) Bigger:
NTSC               PAL
8107B812 1000      8107BCE2 1000

It is also possible to "delete" an object. To delete an object you set it's
image to one that has no collision detection (0100 - Tv Screen), and set it's
size to 0001. You can't see it or touch it, but it's still there. Here's an
example:

"Delete" Metal Crates (Blue Tint):
NTSC               PAL
8107B178 0100      8107B648 0100
8107B17A 0001      8107B64A 0001

This code was used in the Pelagic II in Villa code. It "deletes" most instances
of the metal crates, but where they are put on pads that resize the object you
will see white rectangles.

Not all objects can be changed. Some object modifications simply freeze the
game for no apparent reason. Most codes work though, it's only the odd ones out
that don't like to work. Also, some codes like to work on a PC but not in a
cheating device, or vice-versa.

A few object image values can't be found in the object image lists below. These
are BETA ones like the GoldenEye logo:
00D3 - BETA GoldenEye Logo
0761 - BETA GoldenEye Research Tape
0773 - BETA Briefcase

Modifying weapons
_________________

Just like with objects, it's possible to modify all instances of a weapon. This
is done by changing a weapons type and image. The image modification is done
using the object image modifiers above. The weapons remains modified in all
areas of the game, so if you had a code that replaced the Falcon 2 Silencer
with a PP9i (PP7), you would start Defection with a PP9i (PP7). You would also
get a PP9i (PP7) instead of a Falcon 2 Silencer in multiplayer. Here's an
example:

Change CMP150 into ZZT (9mm) (ZMG (9mm)):
NTSC               PAL

This code is used in Pelagic II in Villa. All the guards in the level use
ZZT (9mm) (ZMG (9mm)) instead of CMP150. One thing to note is that when you aim
you won't see the GoldenEye cursor, but Perfect Darks one instead.

These codes don't fully change a weapon. What's not changed is the zoom, method
of aiming, bullet power, accuracy and sometimes the sound. The PAL version of
the code doesn't change the text (in the above example, when you pick up a
ZZT (9mm) (ZMG (9mm)) for the first time the game say's "Picked up a CMP150").

To give an example of the kind of errors you might get I'll refer to when you
change the Farsight into an AR53. The AR53 will act just like it should do, but
when you aim you will have x-ray vision! The bullets will also shoot through
the walls, which makes this particular AR53 very lethal indeed. Unfortunately
you can't zoom in or "follow lock on" to enemies. An example of a sound error
can be found when you change the Reaper into a KLO1313 (Klobb). When you fire
you'll hear the familiar Reaper spinning, but you will also hear the KLO1313
(Klobb) shooting. The KLO1313 (Klobb) will be as inaccurate as the Reaper.

These errors can be easily avoided be changing weapons that have the same
attributes, like AR34 and AR53, or RCP-120 and RC-P45 (RC-P90). These errors
won't effect how enemies use a gun, but the weapon bullet power will remain the
same as the old gun they used to wield. It won't give the codes to fix the
errors mentioned here because there's already an FAQ on gamefaqs.com which
deals with weapon modifying.

There are four BETA weapons in the game. The first two are the Tester, which
looks like a grenade and fires like a pistol, and the Big King Rocket, which
looks like a rocket launcher and fires strange useless rockets. The other two
are the AR27-BETA and the SMG27-BETA. These weapons have no image and can only
be used once you've picked up a double pair. The easiest place to do this is in
multiplayer, by putting them in weapon slots 1 to 4. Once you have a double
pair of the weapon you can press A to bring it up. Both weapons have a 27
bullet capasity, and use the image of the last held weapon (in the case of none
it uses hands). The AR27-BETA is an assault rifle that sounds like the AR34.
The SMG27-BETA is a sub-machine gun that makes this wierd machine-like sound
when you fire it.

A code for GoldenEye weapons in multiplayer can be found in the Extra Codes
section in the Outro part of this FAQ.

The NTSC and PAL version of these codes vary slightly, so they each have their
own description of how to get the codes working. The weapon number is the
number that's used in-game to refer to a weapon. It's the same for both NTSC
and PAL

PAL Weapon modifier codes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The PAL versions are slightly more complicated in the fact that you sometimes
need to add an extra code to change the value 8006 or 8007. To change the
weapon type, find the weapon you want to change and the weapon you want to
change it to. Use the codes from the weapon you want to change and the values
from the weapon you want to change it to. If the type value A is the same for
both weapons you don't need to use part A of the code. If type value A is
different (I.E one is 8006 and one is 8007) then you need to use part A and B.

You also need to modify the weapon image, which can be done using the second
list. Use the code from the weapon image you want to change, and the value for
the weapon image you want to change it to.

Multiplayer ammo codes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to get your modified weapons working properly in multiplayer you may
have to change the ammo that they use. If you were to change the Falcon 2 into
an AR53 (AR33), you would end up with the AR53 (AR33) as the weapon to pick up,
and two ammo crates full of pistol ammo! The ammo type needs to be changed, and
the amount of ammo needs to be raised so that you get more ammo for the AR53
(AR33). Here's an example:

Change ammo type and amount for the Falcon 2:
NTSC               PAL
80087273 0004      800877C3 0004
80087274 0096      800877C4 0096

This code changes the ammo type to 0004 (assualt rifle ammo), and the ammo
amount to 0096 (150 bullets).

Modifying costumes
__________________

All instances of a costume can be modified in the same way that objects and
weapons can be changed. Unfortunately you can't turn Humans into Skedar or
vice-versa, but you can change Humans into Maians  (I did the Skedar to Humans
code in WAR! in Deep Sea by advanced methods that I won't teach you here). You
can swap heads, bodies and arms around. You can also set the gender of the body
(if the body belongs to a male or female), and you can make it so that all the
guards have the same head.

The following codes modify a list located at NTSC 8007CF06 and PAL 8007D3D6.
The costume number is the number on this list. It can either be a head or a
body. It's important to realise that this list only changes the image of a head
or body. You won't change blood colour or if the head says anything special
(like Cassandra De Vries has loads of Cassandra lines she says). The values
used for the body, head and arm images are taken from the global object list.


Body image modifier codes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first thing you want to do is modify the image of the body a character
uses. Use the three lists below to change body, head and arm images. To make a
code find the body you want to change, and the body you want to change it into.
Use the code from the body you want to change and the value for the body you
want to turn it into. Here's an example:

Pelagic II Guard Body modifier:
NTSC               PAL
8107D906 0266      8107DDD6 0266

This code will turn the Pelagic II guard into a Maian. For most bodies this is
all you have to do, but in this case the body is too short and you get a gap
between the head and the body. This can be solved by modifying the height of
the body. To modify body height make two codes and add 6 and 8 to the body
image modifier address.

Pelagic II Guard Body height is Maian height:
NTSC               PAL
8107D90C 3F12      8107DDDC 3F12
8107D90E A10D      8107DDDE A10D

Wherever the Pelagic II Guard body appears in the game it will be changed into
a Maian, and will be the correct height. The body will not however bleed green
blood or make any Maian sounds when shot.

Common body height values:
3F8D-387D - Mr. Blonde (tallest)
3F80-0000 - Normal height
3F73-FB31 - Joanna Dark (short)
3F12-A10D - Maian (shortest)

Head image modifier codes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you've changed the body you can change the head. To change a head find the
code from the head you want to change, and use the value for the head you want
to change it into. Here's an example:

Turn Daniel Carringtons head into Cassandra De Vries head:
NTSC               PAL
8107CF92 01A6      8107D462

Daniel Carrington will still speak like a man, even though he has Cassandras
head.

Arm image modifier codes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you intend to play as a character body you've changed, you'll notice that
the arms are not changed. To change a set of arms find the body the arms belong
to, and the body which has the arms you want to give the body you've changed.
Use the code from the body you want to change, and the arms value for the arms
you want to give the body. Here's an example:

Change Joanna combat arms into Cassandras arms:

Gender modifying:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Modifying the gender modifies the kind of head a body gets when it's assigned a
head.  If the gender is male the body will act and sound like a male. If the
gender is female the body will act and sound like a female. By modifying the
gender of a body you determine what kind of head that body gets when it's
assigned a random head. It's possible to modify the gender of the head, but
that only changes what kind of pain sounds the head makes. You can only have
females or males. You can't use just a gender modifier and the gender value for
Maians to turn the humans into Maians.

To modify a bodies gender subtract 2 from the address of the body (or head)
image modifier. The values to use are either 2A80 for female, or 827C for male.
You can use others that are shown in the lists above, but what they actually
change makes very little difference as to which head is given to the body.
Here's an example that's used together with the Pelagic II Guard body image
modifier above:

Pelagic II Guard is a Female dataDyne Bodyguard:
NTSC               PAL
8107D904 2A80      8107DDD4 2A80
8107D906 004C      8107DDD6 004C

The guards in Pelagic II will act and sound like women. They will have female
heads and say female things.


Random enemy head modifying:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When a body is assigned a random head it picks out heads from a set of
predetermined heads. This means that is chooses between a set of heads that are
either male or female. The gender value 0DA8 specifies that the body will get
one of only four random female heads. It's possible to change which heads are
chosen when you set the gender to female with the value 0DA8.

Female (0DA8) enemy heads modifier:
NTSC               PAL
81062C5A 00XX      8106293A 00XX
81062C5E 00XX      8106293E 00XX
81062C62 00XX      81062942 00XX
81062C66 00XX      81062946 00XX

The values that these codes use are the costume number values. The codes that
change the body image, head image, arm image and gender modify a list that has
data related to a costume number. There is more data related to a head or body
than what is on this list. This means that elsewhere in the memory there is
another list that specifies what language a head / body says, and what kind of
pain sounds the head / body makes (I haven't been able to locate this list
yet). What all this means is that when you use a costume head value in the code
above you will change which head is assigned to a female gendered body. If that
head is a male head it will speak like a male and have the same pain sounds as
a male. More specifically, if the value is set to that of a Maian head, any
body that the female gender 0DA8 is applied to will become a Maian. If the
values are all set to the same coustume head value then all enemies will have
the same head. Here is an example of how to turn a Human into a Maian:

Turn Pelagic II Guard into Maian Soldier:
NTSC               PAL
8107D904 0DA8      8107DDD4 0DA8
8107D906 0266      8107DDD6 0266
8107D90C 3F12      8107DDDC 3F12
8107D90E A10D      8107DDDE A10D
81062C5A 0029      8106293A 0029
81062C5E 0029      8106293E 0029
81062C62 0029      81062942 0029
81062C66 0029      81062946 0029

The only drawback that this code has is that the Maians will bleed red blood.
Otherwise they will run around and say Maian stuff, just like the two Maian
soldiers in Attack Ship. You can only turn characters that are assign a random
head into Maians. You can't turn Cassandra De Vries into a Maian because she is
always given the same head.

Unfortunately, Skedar language and pain sounds are associated with the Skedar
body (5C). The Skedar body has no head, so you can't use swap Humans with
Skedar using this method.

Moving players into levels
__________________________

When you modify a solo mission so that you put it in a different arena, you
will most likely start the level outside the arena above an empty void. Even
though the objects in the level are put at pads that correspond to the new
arena, anything that takes part in the cut-scene is put exactly where it would
be put if the level hadn't been changed at all. To give an example, at the end
of Crash Site Intro you are put at the coordinates where Joanna starts in Crash
Site. If you were to change the arena Crash Site takes place in to Pelagic II
you will still be put at the coordinates where Joanna starts Crash Site. This
may not nessesarily be in any rooms or corridors in Pelagic II. The result is
that you start the level in an empty void and need to be moved to a place with
a solid floor. If you just stay put you will fall down and die in the void.

This problem can be solved by changing a players coordinates so that you move
her into the level. In order to do this you need to be able to hack Perfect
Dark in hirez. The easiest way to move a player into a level is by using Nemu,
but you can also do this using Project 64 or Perfect Trainer together with
GSCC.


The real time coordinates list:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The real time coordinates list is a list in the memory containing the current
coordinates of all the objects in a level. By changing the coordinates of any
of these objects you can move them wherever you want in an arena. Player
coordinates are located at the end of the real time coordinates list. If you
make a code that moves a player and then remove an object, the code that moved
your player will no longer work because the real time coordinates list will
have one less object in it. Therefore, making a code that moves a player should
be the last thing you do when making a new level. The beginning of the real
time coordinates list can be found by following the pointer at:

NTSC 8009A2F8 and PAL 8009A848

This pointer points to a part of the memory in the in-game level data. It will
point to an address above 80400000. The in-game level data isn't always put in
the memory in the same place, which means that any code you make to alter the
in-game level data won't always work! Whether or not a code works depends on
the last level you loaded, before loading the level the codes activated are
meant to work in. Also, the codes that you have activated may affect the level
that is loaded before the one you want to modify, often causing it to freeze.
To get around these problems while modifying the in-game level data for a solo
mission you need to load the level in a specific way.

Lets say you want to make a code that changes a players coordinates in a
modified level. You want this code to work the first time you load a level, and
when you reload the level (if you die). When Perfect Dark starts, the game will
load the Carrington Institute Training Ground first. From there you can select
your modified level from the Solo Mission menu. When you load your modified
level you will have loaded it after loading the CI Training Ground. At this
point in time you make a code to move the player along the X-axis which will be
814C5670 (example only). Next, you die and reload the level. Your modified
level will now be loaded after loading your modified level (loaded twice). In
this example lets say that the in-game level data is put in a different place.
The code to modify the players X-axis coord is now 814C5680 and not 814C5670.
You have activated a code that freezes a value at 814C5670, but it won't work
because the X-axis coord has moved to 814C5680! The code 814C5670 may freeze
the game because it's changing something it shouldn't be messing with. This
situation can be solved in one of two ways:

1 - You can activate a code so that it works the second time you load the level
    (simply kill yourself the first time the level loads), but this might
    freeze it the first time you load the level.
2 - You can activate a code so that it works the first time you load the
    modified level, and go back to the CI Training Ground and reload it. To
    reload the CI Training Ground you need to kill yourself in it. This can
    easily be done by using the CI Training Ground disabler code (mentioned a
    bit further down in this FAQ).

Sometimes the codes you have activated may prevent the CI Training Ground from
loading, and freeze the game at the Perfect Dark logo. This can also be fixed
with the CI Training Ground disabler. After you've reloaded a level for the
third time the game will be used to loading it. The in-game level data will be
put in the same spot as the second time you loaded it.

When you want to move a player you won't have the code activated all the time.
If you did that the player would be stuck on the same spot and unable to move
anywhere. You will use an activator to move the player into the level when you
press a button. You won't have to worry about your codes freezing anything
because they're not constantly on. However, if you decide to move an object
like a chair that stays in the same spot for the duration of the level, you
won't need an activator. It's when you're not using an activator to modify
in-game data that you have to worry about the order in which you load levels.
In the outro part of this FAQ there are two fully working solo missions, Crash
Site in Villa and WAR! in Deep Sea. Both codes modify the in-game level data
without using activators. WAR! in Deep Sea loads it's in-game data in the same
spot after loading itself, so there aren't any problems with getting it working
again if you die. Crash Site in Villa puts it's in-game data in a different
place after you have loaded it. If you die you have to go back to the disabled
CI Training Ground, kill yourself, and then load the level again. If you plan
to move anything without activators it's best not to use the skip intros code,
because you have no level to go back to after loading your modified level for
the first time.


Finding your current coordinates:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'm going to describe how to find your current coordinates, and codes to change
them, in three different ways. Using Nemu, using Project 64 and ArtMoney, and
using Perfect Trainer together with GSCC. The example I'm going to use is Crash
Site in Pelagic II. When you load this level you appear outside the level.

Crash Site in Pelagic II:
NTSC               PAL
8107FE88 000E      810803C8 000E
8107FE8A 0160      810803CA 0160
8107FE8C 015F      810803CC 015F

Turn on the above code and select Crash Site from the Solo Mission menu. The
in-game level data will be put in a different spot depending on which
difficulty you choose. The best thing to do is select Perfect Agent. You'll be
able to modify enemy difficulty in Perfect Dark Agent mode. Start the level and
watch the cut-scene if you like. You will begin outside the level, so to get
into it you need to moonjump there. Use the moonjump codes provided in Part One
and moonjump into the level. Once inside navigate to the exact spot where you
want to start the level and pause the game.

In Nemu go to Plugins - Debugger: Memory... In the address box enter the
address NTSC 8009A2F8 or PAL 8009A848. Copy the pointer you find there into the
address box to navigate to the real time coordinates list. Move down the list
by changing the address until you get to the end of the real time coordinates
list and find the value 060C0000 (or 068C0000). Alternatively you can do a
search for 060C0000 (or 068C0000) and the correct address will be the one
closest to where the real time coordinates list is in the memory. After
060C0000 you will find a pointer and three 32bit values. Write down the values
and addresses these values are at to make the move player code. Move the Memory
window and the game screen window in such a way that you can see them both on
the same screen. Right click on the three 32bit values to highlight them green
and make them easier to see. Unpause the game and go to where you want to move
something else. In the Memory window press Refresh to get the new coordinates
of where you moved to.

In Project 64 create a savestate and open it in a hex editor. Delete the first
75C addresses and byte flip the file. Go to NTSC 8009A2F8 or PAL 8009A848 and
follow the pointer found there to find the real time coordinates list. Do a
search for 060C0000 (or 068C0000) and the correct address will be the one
closest to the real time coordinates list (or just scroll down to the end of
the real time coordinates list to find the value 060C). After 060C0000 you will
find a pointer and three 32bit values. Write down the values and addresses
these values are at to make the move player code. Turn on ArtMoney and connect
it to Project 64 (which should still be paused using F2). Do three different
searches for the 32bit values found with the hex editor, and move the three
codes over to the active code section. Place the Project 64 window in such a
fashion so that you can see both the game screen and the values at the same
time. When you unpause the game you should be able to see the coordinates
changing as you move about the level. Move about to find coordinates for where
you want to put other stuff you wish to move.

For Perfect Trainer and GSCC you need to activate the level modifier by
changing values in the ram manually. This is done by using the ram edit menu.
Once the code is active load the level and pause the game. Use the same method
described above to find your current coordinates. Pressing Refresh will update
your computer with your latest coordinates.


Moving a player with activators:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Whatever method you used you should now know where your coordinates are and
which addresses they are at. Remember that they may be at a different address
the second time you load the level, so quit and load the level again to make
sure they're correct. What you have should look like this (NTSC PC version):

005443E0 - 060C0000 80561860 45A4BE67 C3B0CAC8
005443F0 - C4F46CCE C4CE3E34 00000000 00000000

The first 32bit value after the pointer 80561860 is the X coord, the next is Y
and the third is Z. You only need to change the first 16bits, these give you
more than enough coordinate precision. A code to move your player would be:

815443E8 XXXX
815443EC YYYY
815443F0 ZZZZ

In total there may be six different versions of this code, NTSC PC version 1.0
and 1.1, PAL PC, NTSC Gameshark version 1.0 and 1.1, and PAL Action Replay.
Consequently it turns out that both NTSC version 1.0 and 1.1 put their in-game
level data in the same place for this particular level modification, so there's
actually only four. To find NTSC Gameshark and PAL Action Replay versions you
need to use Perfect Trainer, but you can also guess you way to them based on
their PC counterparts. The cheating device version will be in the 10's away
from the PC version. This means that it could be +50, +20, +10 to name but a
few. The cheating device version of a PC coordinate code can therefore usually
be found by trial and error.

8107FE88 000E
8107FE8A 0160
8107FE8C 015F
D109C7E4 0030
815443E8 449A
D109C7E4 0030
815443EC C488
D109C7E4 0030
815443F0 4237

NTSC               PAL                NTSC PC            PAL PC
81544408 XXXX      81541B08 XXXX      815443E8 XXXX      81541AE8 XXXX
8154440C YYYY      81541B0C YYYY      815443EC YYYY      81541AEC YYYY
81544410 ZZZZ      81541B10 ZZZZ      815443F0 ZZZZ      81541AF0 ZZZZ

As you can see, the difference between cheating device and PC in this case is
+20. It's usually the same for both NTSC and PAL.

The next thing you need is a set of coordinates from where you want to start
the level:

449AFFA8 C4886009 42374903

Using these coords and the one player button activator you can make the codes
that move your player. The button combination L+R (0030) is used because it's
unlikely the player will press this combination while playing.

NTSC               PAL                NTSC PC            PAL PC

The final code should be:

Crash Site in Pelagic II:
NTSC               PAL                NTSC PC            PAL PC
8107FE88 000E      810803C8 000E      8107FE88 000E      810803C8 000E

81544408 449A      81541B08 449A      815443E8 449A      81541AE8 449A
D109C7E4 0030      D1099FB0 0030      D109C7E4 0030      D1099FB0 0030
8154440C C488      81541B0C C488      815443EC C488      81541AEC C488
D109C7E4 0030      D1099FB0 0030      D109C7E4 0030      D1099FB0 0030
81544410 4237      81541B10 4237      815443F0 4237      81541AF0 4237

This code works by pressing L+R when the level starts. You will be magically
teleported to the start of the level. It works the second time you load the
level in the cheating device versions. The aim of the level is to kill as many
guards as possible while avoiding being flanked and walking into booby traps!

Last but not least you should test any codes you make to make sure that they
work as they should do.


The CI Training Ground Disabler:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some time during making a level setup you might experience the game freezing at
the Perfect Dark logo. This happens because the codes you've made are either
put in the same place as the objects used in the Carrington Institute Training
Ground, or interfere with the intro cut-scene. The way to get around this and
to make things work again is to disable the CI Training Ground. Hard as it may
sound, disabling the CI Training Ground is done quite simply by modifying the
level it's in. The Training Ground is at level number 26 on the level list.

Carrington Institute Training Ground Disabler:
NTSC               PAL
810800B8 0001      810805F8 0001
810800BA 0184      810805FA 0184
810800BC 0183      810805FC 0183
810800BE 013C      810805FE 013C

The last line changes the CI Traing Grounds setup into Skedar's solo setup
(013C). It's a BETA setup, it has no cut-scenes and no objects in it, only the
player. Usually the last line is enough to get things working again, but if it
doesn't, use the rest of the code. The rest of the code changes the arena into
the Default arena. If all else fails, try 0147 as a setup instead of 013C. In
the Default arena you can easily walk off the edge of the level and kill
yourself. This resets the way levels work and is useful for levels like Crash
Site in Villa (Solo).

Something else you may want to note about the CI Training Ground is that player
one is always invincible! Don't use level 26 for anything other than the
Training Ground, if you do you will end up with an invincible player. Use
Defense instead, it works just as well.

_______________________________________________________________________________

Everything that I have taught you up till now has been a simplified version of
Perfect Dark level modding. It is in fact possible to take things one step
further than just changing a levels setup files. It's possible to move stuff
around in levels, and to change objects at a much deeper level. However,
advanced level modding is hard to do, extremely time consuming and requires a
lot of foreground work before you can even start changing stuff. When I started
writing this FAQ I originally had in mind to explain how advanced level modding
is done. Due to time constraints and a general lack of actual Perfect Dark
hackers (lets face it, we're few and far between), I decided to axe most of the
stuff about advanced level modding. I will however explain how I made the
multiplayer levels.

Examples of advanced level modding can be seen in the codes in the "Codes"
section. They are fully working levels, with everything as you would expect it
to be, not with ammo crates stuck in windows, or gigantic lifts flying in the
air.

Multiplayer level modding
_________________________

It is my wish that one day we will be able to play in all of Perfect Darks solo
arenas in multiplayer. Sadly I don't have the time to do them all myself, but I
will however provide you with a quick guide that will help you understand how I
made the ones that I did and how to make your own.

In this FAQ you will find the multiplayer levels that I have created. These are
done using the method that I found to be most effective and low on lines of
code. The multiplayer codes that you make will be much like the ones that I
have made. They consist of several different parts, and require an enabler to
get them working. A quick breakdown of the steps of making a multiplayer level
are:

1 -> Making the level modifier code
2 -> Creating the enablers
3 -> Plotting the pads in the level
4 -> Creating the code
5 -> Testing the code

To make the level modifier code you need to decide on which arena you want to
play in multiplayer, and which multiplayer setup file to use. The setup file is
important because it will determine which extra objects you want to add beyond
all the usual stuff. You can't add any more objects than there are in the setup
file to begin with. This means that if there are only five metal crates in
Complexes setup your level will also only have five metal crates. You can
however modify them into different objects (like I did in Crash Site Caves).
Bases setup is good if you want lots of objects, and Felicity's or Area 52's is
good if you want lots of doors. You won't be making a level that has every
single bit of furniture in place like it's solo version. Carrington Villa
Residence and Rooftop demonstrate the extent to which you can have objects in a
multiplayer level. Residence has lots of doors and Rooftop has lots of objects.

Once you've made a level modifier code you need to find where the in-game level
data for this level is put in each mode of the level. Modes are the level
loaded in different formats (NTSC Gameshark version 1.0, NTSC Gameshark
version 1.1, PAL Action Replay, NTSC PC version 1.0, NTSC PC version 1.1, and
PAL PC), and the level loaded with different player amounts. There are 24
different modes in total. For PC's the in-game level data is found using Nemu
or Project 64 with ArtMoney, for cheating devices you need to use Perfect
Trainer. I realise that this part can be a lot of hassle so I have found out
where the in-game level data is put for you! I have compiled a list over where
the data is put in each of Perfect Darks solo arenas when loaded in
multiplayer. This list will save you a lot of time and ensure that your codes
will work. Once you know where the in-game level data is put you can make
enablers for each format. The enablers will work in the same way as the ones
that I have made for my levels. You need to choose one of the modes which the
final code will be put at. This has to be the highest in the memory (which is
usually NTSC Gameshark one player). Once you know where the final code will be
you can make enablers for the other modes which move the in-game level data up
the memory to line up with where the final code is. In essence the enablers
move the in-game level data to the same place as in NTSC Gameshark one player
mode. This is why you end up with codes that work in both NTSC and PAL.

Once you know where the final code is going to be put, and that it will work
with every mode no matter which side of the Atlantic you are on, you can start
making codes to move the objects. You can at this point make the final code,
but you will realise that you won't know where to move the objects. The objects
are placed on the pads, and the codes you make will move the objects to a
different pad. In order to know where to move stuff you need to make a map
of the level and draw where each pad is in the arena. For some of the larger
levels you only need to know where the first hundred or so pads are, you don't
need to know where every single pad is, there's more than enough of them to
create your level. Pads are found by using object moving codes to move objects
to the pads you want to find. Each object is given it's own image so you can
tell the difference between them. With all objects put at different pads and
with different object images you can find the pads in no time by running around
the arena looking for them.

Once you know where the pads are and know where the final code will be put in
the memory you can create the codes that move and modify stuff. You will need
codes to move weapons and ammo crates, codes to move the respawns and codes
that move and modify objects. King of the Hill and Capture the Case codes are
the same for all levels and aren't part of the in-game level data. Creating the
code that moves stuff about and changes it is done by modifying several
different object setup files, and the pads file. The files are pointed to from
NTSC 8009D030 and PAL 8009D590. These pointers point to in-game level data:

NTSC Pointer - PAL Pointer - File description

  8009D040   -  8009D5A0   - Object setup list
  8009D04C   -  8009D5AC   - The pads file
  8009D03C   -  8009D59C   - Multiplayer respawns, hills and bases
  8009D03C   -  8009D59C   - Solo mission player info
  8009D044   -  8009D5A4   - Solo mission AI
  8009A2F8   -  8009A848   - Real time object coordinates list

The object setup list is the most important, it contains information about the
weapons, ammo crates, doors and objects. The weapons and ammo come first and
are in the same order in almost every setup (except Ravine). This means that no
matter wether you use Complexes, Bases or Felicity's setup the weapons and ammo
codes will always be the same. Take note that the weapons and ammo code is the
same in both Crash Site Caves and Crash Site Racing Ground. It's also the same
in Carrington Villa Residence and Carrington Villa Rooftop. Any objects that
come with the setup will come next and you can modify them as you want. After
the objects comes the respawn point data that you will also need to change. The
pads file will be put in a different place depending on wether you use NTSC or
PAL. Codes that modify the pads file are therefore put in part one of the code
together with the level modifier. Changing a pad means moving it's coordinates
to put it exactly where you want it. You should only need to move pads in
extreme circumstances, like if you want a lift somewhere but there aren't any
pads for it to move between.

I'll mention the solo specific files breifly since I'm sure you're curious as
to what they contain. The solo mission player info file has information about
the weapons and ammo you start the level with. The solo mission AI has enemy /
allie routine data, like respawning guards, guard behavior and guard
destinations. Unlike the other files this one is compact with no reguard to the
fact that certain values should start with an even address (you'll understand
what I mean when you see it).

Once you've made the code it needs to be tested. This has to be done to make
sure that the final code works with the enablers.


Making the level modifier code:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lets take a look at the level modifier code used in Crash Site Racing Ground:

Crash Site in multi using Bases Mp_Setup:
NTSC               PAL
810800B8 0001      810805F8 0001      CI Training Ground Disabler
810800BA 0184      810805FA 0184                  V
810800BC 0183      810805FC 0183                  V
810800BE 013C      810805FE 013C                  V
8107FE90 01E2      810803D0 01E2      Crash Site Mp_Setup modifier (using Base)
80084BF9 001C      80085149 001C      Random level modifier (using Crash Site)
81084BFC 569B      8108514C 569B      Changes Random (arena) into Crash Site
81084C14 50FF      81085164 50FF      Changes Random (arena type) into Hacker

The CI Training Ground Disabler is needed to stop the game from freezing once
you've made the final code. The level is loaded by choosing what was originally
meant to be at Random. Instead of loading a random level we use a random level
modifier to always make it load the level we want. The two last codes change
the words Random that you find in the arena menu. The Mp_Setup modifier changes
Crash Sites Mp_Setup. Since Crash Site doesn't have an Mp_Setup, if we don't
change this the level will freeze. The code to change the Mp_Setup and the
values for the level and Mp_Setup can be found in Part One - The level
modifier. Some common Mp_Setup values are:

01E2 - Base     - 24 metal crates, 5 slide up doors and 2 lifts
020A - Felicity - 12 swing doors of which there are 4 double doors, 7 slide
                  across doors, 8 unbreakable panes of glass
011B - Complex  - 5 metal crates
0104 - Ravine   - 20 metal crates with 16 moveable and 4 unmoveable, 1 lift
0202 - Ruins    - 10 faulty slide across doors with 5 double doors
01EA - Area 52  - 8 slide up doors, 12 move up/down doors which open
                  automatically of which there are 6 double doors, 8 breakable
                  panes of glass

Choose a setup file depending on what kind of objects you want in your
multiplayer level. You don't need to have lots of objects or doors, most of the
original levels in Perfect Dark have no objects in them. Which setup file you
use has no affect on where the in-game level data is put. If you want more
objects or want to do another different level within the same arena simply
change the Mp_Setup file you're using. You won't be able to modify how doors
open, so think carefully wether you use Felicity or Area 52.

Values for the level name are:
5687  dataDyne Research
5689  dataDyne Central
568B  Carrington Villa
568D  Chicago
568F  G5 Building
5691  Area 51
5697  Air Base
5699  Air Force One
569B  Crash Site
569D  Pelagic II
569F  Deep Sea
56A1  Carrington Institute
56A3  Attack Ship
56A5  Skedar Ruins

An example of a level modifier for Skedar Ruins in multiplayer would be:

Skedar Ruins in multi using Bases Mp_Setup:
NTSC               PAL
810800B8 0001      810805F8 0001
810800BA 0184      810805FA 0184
810800BC 0183      810805FC 0183
810800BE 013C      810805FE 013C
810801A0 01E2      810806E0 01E2
80084BF9 002A      80085149 002A
81084BFC 56A5      8108514C 56A5
81084C14 50FF      81085164 50FF

Before going any further it's a good idea to test your level modifier to see if
it works. Certain combinations won't work, but most levels load with the setup
files mentioned above.


Creating the enablers:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now that you have a level modifier code for your multiplayer level it's time to
make the enablers. Most of the codes in the level will be modifying the in-game
level data which is put rather randomly all over the place. The enablers allow
you to choose where the codes should be in each player amount mode and format.
This allows you to use just one set of codes instead of 24 different codes.
Lets have a look at some enablers from Carrington Villa in multi. Carrington
Villa in multiplayerputs it's in-game level data in different places between
NTSC version 1.0 and 1.1. We therefore need two different enablers for NTSC
Gameshark users.

Once the game has started you have to go straight to the multiplayer menu,
select your level from the arena menu without changing anything else and load
the level with one player only. You always have to do this because the in-game
level data will be put somewhere randomly. I'll refur to this as the unstable
one player mode. I use the object setup list pointer as a measure of where the
in-game level data is put. For NTSC Gameshark (version 1.1) the pointer will at
this stage be 804F06A0. Quit the level and load it again with one player. The
in-game level data will now be put slightly higher up in the memory. I'll refur
to this as the stable one player mode. Stable means that even though you load
it a third time, the level data will still be put in the same place as when it
was stable. The pointer will now be 804F06E0. For the PC versions there is no
stable or unstable placing of the level data. After the stable one player mode
you can then find where the other player amount modes will be put because the
level has stabilised in the memory and won't be put randomly somewhere else.
These are 804E8E40 for two players and 804E8D00 for three and four players
(these usually differ, but in this case it's the same for both three and four
player).

Once you know where the in-game level data is put you then have to choose where
the final code will be. For Carrington Villa I chose 804F7D70 (which was where
the one player stable mode for NTSC Gameshark version 1.0 is). The final code
must be put higher in the memory than any of the other modes. No matter which
mode is being used the object setup list pointer has to always be 804F7D70 for
the code to work. We make sure it is by using the following code:

In-game level data placement modifier:
NTSC               PAL
81099408 XXXX      81099958 XXXX
8109940A XXXX      8109995A XXXX

This code modifies a pointer which usually has the value 80400000 I.E the start
of the extra 4MB given by the Expansion Pak. The in-game level data will be put
at 80400000 onwards. By increasing this pointer (and only increasing it) the
level data will be put further up in the memory, and the object setup list will
line up with the codes you have activated. You can't put the level data further
down in the memory because it will overwrite what comes before 80400000. For
the unstable NTSC Gameshark one player mode (version 1.1) you need to subtract
804F06A0 from 804F7D70 (use Windows Calculator in Scientific Mode). This gives
you the value 76D0, which is what we use as a value in the code above. When the
unstable one player mode is loaded the pointer has to be 804076D0 (using the
code 8109940A 76D0). For higher values you need to use both lines of code. The
code for the stable one player mode would be 8109940A 7690, two player is
8109940A EF30 and three and four player are 8109940A F070. To make sure the
value of the in-game level data pointer is correct at the right times we use a
combination of button activators and player menu amount activators. A breakdown
of the NTSC Gameshark enabler is:

NTSC Gameshark Version 1.1 Enabler:
D109C7E4 0030 - Activate next code when L+R is pressed
8109940A 76D0 - Move level data +76D0
D109C7E4 0020 - Activate next code when L is pressed
8109940A 7690 - Move level data +7690
D00714DB 0002 - Activate next code when two player menus are active
8109940A EF30 - Move level data +EF30
D00714DB 0003 - Activate next code when three player menus are active
8109940A F070 - Move level data +F070
D00714DB 0004 - Activate next code when four player menus are active
8109940A F070 - Move level data +F070

Instructions:
Go straight to the Advanced Combat Simulator menu. Select Crash Site with one
player but before entering the level press and hold L+R for a few seconds. When
letting go make sure you pull your finger off L before R. Load the level and
quit as soon as possible. Back at the Advanced Menu press and hold L for a few
seconds. Load Crash Site with one player again and quit. The code should work
from then on. You can turn on the amount of players you want to play with. You
can also switch between different player amounts. When switching back to one
player mode you have to press L before loading the level. Allow time for each
players independent multiplayer menu to appear before loading the level. Don't
quickly add/remove another player and start the game before his menu has time
to appear/disappear. Don't use the drop out function.

All you need to create enablers is to know where the in-game level data is put
during each mode and where you want the final code to be. As I mentioned
earlier on, finding where the level data is put can be a pain in the arse,
especially if you don't have access to one of the formats (like NTSC Gameshark
or PAL Action Replay). I have therefore compiled a list of where the level data
is put in all modes for all 14 solo only arenas!


The following list shows where the start of the object setup list is during
each mode. I found the values using the level modifier provided. It's the arena
files and not the setup file which decides where the in-game level data is put.
You can therefore use a different Mp_Setup than the one I used and the enablers
you make will still work. Where there are two pointers provided the first will
be version 1.0 and the second will be 1.1.

I'm now going to show you how to create a totally new set of enablers for that
Skedar Ruins in multi level modifier I made earlier. The object setup list
locations for all modes are:

The next thing we need to do is to decide on where the final code is going to
be put. The highest of all the addresses is the NTSC Gameshark mode (804FFD50).
Before we choose this however lets look at what else should be considered. It's
entirely possible to make in-game level data modifying codes that work in
several different arenas. Below you will find a list of the highest addresses
from all arenas. You will notice that some of them put their level data near by
one another.

dataDyne Central     - 804F07D0
dataDyne Research    - 804FAC60
Carrington Villa     - 804F7D70 (Put at 804F7D70)
Chicago              - 804E3B70
G5 Building          - 804E6EC0
Area 51              - 8052A120

Air Force One        - 80517110
Crash Site           - 80502A50 (Put at 80502A50)
Pelagic II           - 80530140
Deep Sea             - 80534E30
Carrington Institute - 804F3500
Attack Ship          - 8053A0D0
Skedar Ruins         - 804FFD50

Skedar Ruins and dataDyne Research put their level data at 804FFD50 and
804FAC60. You could put the final code at 804FFD50 and make enablers for both
levels that put the object setup list at 804FFD50. This would save you having
to make two different codes for the two levels. The only thing you would have
to change is the pads values in the object moving codes. If the same setup file
is being used in both levels things get easier, but if the setup is different
we need to make two different sets of object codes. If you can choose where in
the memory the object setup list is put, why not just have every level put it
at 80540000? If you did then most of the levels wouldn't work properly. You
shouldn't put the final code further than 6000 away from where it's originally
meant to be.

Back to the Skedar Ruins in multiplayer code, for sake of clarity lets put the
final code at 80500000. We next have to find the difference between 80500000
and all the other addresses:

The level must be loaded first with one player, and then with one player again.
For the cheating device version you need to press L+R before the first time and
L before the second time. Once you've loaded the level twice you can select
other player amount modes. You should be able to switch between player amount
modes without the game freezing.

These enablers will work for the most part, but some of the modes may not work
properly as you might expect. They need to be tested as well to see if they
work. The final complete code may change the method of which the enablers work,
so there's no point in testing them until we've finished the code. For now
these will do. If you experience any problems at this stage jump to "Testing
the code" to solve them.

Now would be a good time to make a savestate using the enabler while the object
setup list is at 80500000. You'll be able to use such a savestate to create the
codes without having to turn the game on all the time.


Plotting the pads in the level:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now that you know where the codes that modify the in-game level data will be
put, you can begin making codes that modify it. We need to know where the pads
are so the first thing we want to do is create a code that helps us to find the
pads. It's a good idea to make a rough but accurate sketch of the arena from a
top down view. As you find the pads you can draw their numbers on this sketch.
You're going to be finding the pads by using the objects in Bases Mp_Setup, so
change your level modifier code so that it uses Base. By giving the objects (59
in total) each their own object image and placing them at pads around the arena
you can run around identifying where each pad is, finding 59 at a time.

In the example I'm going to show you here I'll be finding the pads in Skedar
Ruins. From Part One we can see that Skedar Ruins has 152 (in hex) pads. Thats
338 in decimal. The final code is put at 80500000 onwards and I need codes that
modify the weapons, ammo crates and objects. All these codes will be modifying
the object setup list. In the object setup list each object has initial data
about it which is used when the level is loaded. The list isn't used (much)
when the level is running, so for the codes to take effect you need to re-load
the level. Bases setup has two lifts, five doors and 24 metal crates. We won't
be using the lifts.

All objects use the same method when being represented on the object setup
list, but they use different values. Certain objects take up more memory than
others because they have more information. In the following code extraction you
will see the code that represents the first weapon from Base, starting at the
beginning of the object setup list which is 80500000:

80500000 - 0100 0408 00F5 002C 0000 0001 0000 0000
80500010 - 0000 0000 8050 BDA0 8050 8850 BDCC 8000

First comes the value 0100. This is almost always 0100 but can sometimes be
0099 for ammo crates. You don't need to change this. The next value is 0408. 04
is the local size modifier which will modify the size of just this particular
weapon. 08 is the object type, which in this case is 08 for weapon. Next up
comes the in-game object image value. You'll find a list of the in-game image
values in the Resources section. This particular weapon turns out to be a
Falcon 2 (00F5). Take note that this modifies just the weapons image and not
the weapon itself. The next value is the most important one because it's the
pad the Falcon 2 is put at (002C). Changing this will put the Falcon 2
somewhere else in the arena. Right down at the bottom you will find the value
0200. This is the weapon type value, so changing this will change the weapon
type (but not the weapons image). You'll also find a list of weapon types in
the Resources section. All the other values are relativly useless for now. The
pointer 8050BDA0 points to where the Falcon 2 is on the real time object
coordinates list.

All objects have the same first 16bit digits (but with different values). This
makes it easy to find an object on the object setup list. If you know it's
image value you can do a search for that. If you know which pad it's put at you
can find it by searching for its pad number. For now all we're going to be
modifying is the object image and object pad position. In Bases Mp_Setup the
objects come in the following order, and are put at the pads shown next to
them:

We'll start by making codes that modify the weapons. There are 6 different
weapons put at 10 different places. That means that there are going to be 6
different weapon object images. We have to change the 4 weapons that are
doubles, so that we don't end up with two objects that look the same. To
change them we need to change both the object image and the weapon type. We
need to load the level with the following weapon settings:

1: Falcon 2 (Silencer) - 00FB
2: Falcon 2 (Scope)    - 00FC
3: Magsec 4            - 00F6
4: Mauler              - 00F7
5: Phoenix             - 00FA
6: DY357 Magnum        - 00F8

The first thing we want to do is make codes that move all of the 10 different
weapons. To do this, search for their weapon image, followed by the pad they
are put at (like 00FB002C for weapon 1.1, or 00FC002D for weapon 2.1) within
the object setup list. Between each weapon is 1B8 8bit values, so an alternate
way to find the codes is add 1B8 to the weapon code to find the next weapon.

Move weapons into pads:
81500006 0XXX  -  Weapon 1.1  -  Falcon 2 (Silencer)
815001BE 0XXX  -  Weapon 2.1  -  Falcon 2 (Scope)
81500376 0XXX  -  Weapon 3.1  -  Magsec 4
8150052E 0XXX  -  Weapon 4.1  -  Mauler
815006E6 0XXX  -  Weapon 5    -  Phoenix
8150089E 0XXX  -  Weapon 6    -  DY357 Magnum
81500A56 0XXX  -  Weapon 1.2  -  Farsight XR-20

81500DC6 0XXX  -  Weapon 3.2  -  Horizon Scanner
81500F7E 0XXX  -  Weapon 4.2  -  CamSpy

To change the doubles we need to change both the weapon image and weapon type.
If we change just the weapon type, the weapon image will automatically become
0000 (Ceiling dronegun), and will block everything in sight with a gray haze.
While we're at it we might as well turn the four weapons into something useful.
To change the weapon image, just change the 16bit value before the pad number
(subtract 2 from the address of the pad modifier). To change the weapon type,
add 56 to the pad modifier.

Moving ammo crates and metal crates is pretty easy. Just find the object image
number and pad. Ammo crates are object image number 00C1, and metal crates are
0021. We have to change both the object image and pad.

Ammo crates come is sets of two. Between the first two is A8 8bit values, and
between the second and third is 110. Between the third and fourth is A8, and
the fourth and fith have 110 between them, and so on and so on... Add the
values A8 or 110 onto the last ammo crate code to easily find codes for all 20
ammo crates. To find the first one, do a search for 00C10036. Check the last
code (00C10049) to see if the calculations were correct.

To find the first metal crate, do a search for 00210053. Between metal crates
there are 5C 8bit values, so add 5C onto each code to get the next metal crate
pad mod. The last metal crate can be found by searching for 0021006A.

The lifts will be put at pads 4C and 4B, and will be object image number 2E. To
find them easily on the object setup list simply do a search for 002E004C or
002E004B. We don't want to use the lifts so we remove them by making their
local size 00 and object type 08:

Remove lifts:
81501142 0008
815011E6 0008

We can use the five doors as well, but they need to be turned into objects
first. We do this by making their size 0C and their object type 15. Once we've
done this we can change their image and move them. To find the first door, do a
search for 00BF004E.

Change doors into objects:
8150127A 0C15

We now have all the codes we need to get started. The next thing that needs to
be done is to assign an object image to all the 59 objects. The best object
images to use are the weapon item images. These are neither to small, nor to
big to be in the way. You can only use about 30 weapon images, the rest has to
be other small sized items. Most of the object images that fit are:

This list is ordered with the smallest object image at the top, and gradually
bigger images the further down you go. Use the big objects for ammo crates, and
the smaller objects for metal crates (remember that you can't walk through the
objects that were originally metal crates). Also take note that the weapons and
ammo crates won't get resized if the pad tries to reshape them. Metal crates
will get resized and reshaped, so try to give them images you can easily tell
the difference between, or recognise easily.

The final code should be compiled with the pad modifiers in one part and the
rest of the codes in another. Each part shouldn't be more than 60 lines long
because that's about how many lines you can input for each code in a cheating

To use this code put the number of the pad you want to find in one of the pad
modifiers and search the arena for its corresponding object image. To give an
example, if pad number 003C is put at the code that modifies the position of
the first door, search the level for a DMC (Deutch) and the spot you find it
will be where pad 003C is located. Then draw the number 3C on the map of the
arena that you've drawn before hand.

As you start finding out where the pads are you will start to see patterns in
how they are placed. The are several different types of pads to be found. The
first kind of pads that you will find, and the most useful when it comes to
placing weapons and ammo crates, are navigational pads. These are used by the
AI (sims and guards) as path finders, telling them where to walk and how to
navigate around a level. There should be loads of navigational pads depending
on how big the level is. All navigational pads have are coordinates, they don't
have any other information. These pads are great for putting weapons or ammo
crates at because they are usually found in a line, and will all be alligned
correctly. The next kind of pads you come across will be the enemy positions.
These have a direction defined which makes them excellent respawn pads. After
the navigational and enemy pads come the object pads where the furniture and
doors from the arenas solo mission are put. These pads will reshape and resize
what's put at them because they're meant to be used with a specific object
image only (weapons and ammo crates won't get resized though). Door pads can
be tested by putting a door there, and turning off the object image and object
type code for that door.

You don't have to find every single pad in the arena. If all you want is a
simple multiplayer level then all you need to know is where the navigational
and enemy pads are. If however you want to recreate an object from the arenas
solo mission, like a door, the easiest way to find it is to search the arenas
solo mission object setup list. Simply do a search for the objects image value.
In the Resources section you will find a list of object images that are sorted
by level. To give an example, if I wanted to find the spinning power generator
pillar from Skedar Ruins I'd do a search for 007A. Once I've located the
correct object, all I need to do is write down the value of the next 16bit
digit after 007A. In this case it turns out to be 0126, which is where the
spinning pillar is put.


At this point in time it's probably a good idea I told you that you don't need
to remake the pads finder above. If you want to find the pads in a different
arena (except dataDyne Research, for which the code can be reused), you can
simply port the code. Say you want to find the pads in Attack Ship. After
you've made the enablers you end up with the final code starting at 80540000.
The final code for Skedar Ruins starts at 80500000. To port the pads finder
code you need to first find the difference between the two pointers, 80540000 -
80500000 = 40000. Simply add 40000 to the address of every code that modifies
the in-game level data. Remember to make sure that the level modifier uses
Bases Mp_Setup. Likewise you could port one of the multiplayer levels that I
have made so that they work in Skedar Ruins. You would need to change the
values of the codes to correspond with the new set of pads.

If you've made a pads map, either on a PC or scanned in like I did, please
share it with other people so that they can use it too. I've found the pads in
Crash Site, Villa (Solo), Skedar Ruins and Deep Sea, so you don't need to do
any of them.


Creating the code:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now that you know where the pads are and where the final code will be put you
can begin creating the code to move stuff about. Your aim will be to create a
multiplayer level in which there are no objects out of place. You'll also want
to place enough objects in the level that it looks like it's original solo
mission, although that isn't neccesary. Many of PD's original multiplayer
levels don't have objects in them at all. You don't want to clutter the level
up so much that it becomes hard to move around.

The final complete code will consist of codes that:
-> Modify a level (Part One)
-> Move the weapons and ammo crates (Part Two)
-> Modify and move the objects (Part Three)
-> Move the respawn points (Part Four)
-> Move the Hills (also Part Four)
-> Move the Bases and their respawn points (Part Five)
-> Multiplayer level enablers for all formats


Moving the weapons and ammo crates requires a pad modifier for each object. You
already have the pad modifiers for these from the pads finder code, but if
you're starting from scratch there is an easy way to find them. For all
Mp_Setups except Ravine the weapons and ammo crates will come first on the
object setup list, and in the same order. This means that you could simply port
the codes from one of my multiplayer levels. If you don't want to port the
codes another way of doing it is to find the first weapon pad modifier code.
Add 68 to find the first ammo crate, then add A8 to find the next. Add A8 again
to find the next weapon and 68 to find it's first ammo crate, and so on and so
on, until you've made codes for all 10 weapon points. A quick way of finding
the first weapon pad modifier (for all setups except Ravines) is to add 6 to
the object setup list pointer. You can also subtract 6 from the first weapon
pad modifier to find where the final code is put in my multiplayer level codes.
The codes that move the weapons and ammo crates for Skedar Ruins are:

When you place the weapon points at pads around the arena you need to make sure
you put them in accessible places. If you don't the sims won't be able to get
them. Where the weapon points are put will determine where the sims go, and the
power of the weapon will determine which weapon all the sims are trying to get
at. Sims won't go into parts of the level where there aren't any weapons, so
the weapon placements will determine the flow of the level. Put the double
weapons at opposite sides of the level and not next to each other. Put weapons
5 and 6 in places you want the sims to go. Since there are only one of these
you can place a powerful weapon or shield at these weapon points. Quite
annoyingly the sims know when there is a weapon there or if it's just been
taken. Put a weapon too far away from where the main action takes place and you
will see lots of sims running there to get it. You will also see them turn
around half way there because they know that another sim has got it before
them! Remember to check the weapon points to make sure that you can pick up all
the objects that you've moved. I placed the weapon points in Skedar Ruins at
the following places:

Weapon 1.1 - Rectangular pillar room (without Skedar relic)

We'll jump over the objects for now and do the respawns first. The respawns can
be found by following the pointer at NTSC 8009D03C or PAL 8009D59C. You'll find
a list of numbers which are the pads the respawns are put at. You simply need
to change these values. Base has 16 respawns ranging from 1C to 2B. Once you've
found the code that moves the first respawn, simply add C to the address to
find the next respawn placement modifier. The code to move respawn points in
Skedar Ruins is:

Respawn points can be placed wherever you want, but for best results place them
on enemy pads. Some pads won't accept a respawn being placed on them. Instead
you will appear in nothingness and die. To avoid this you need to test all the
pads you intend to put your respawn points at. The following code allows you to
test one pad at a time. If you're using an N64 emulator then you can change
this code without having to reload the level. Put lots of Rocket Launchers in
the level so that you can kill yourself easily.

The Hills from King of the Hill are easy to modify providing you know where the
pads are. Hills are placed at pads and the room the pad is in gets highlighted.
The codes that modify the Hills work in all levels because they don't modify
the in-game level data. You do however need to know where the pads are in order
to get any use out of them. You can make codes that simply change the existing
Hills, or you can increase the amount of Hills giving you a total of nine
different Hills.

King of the Hill Modifier:
NTSC               PAL
800AC11D 000X      800AC6BD 000X  -  Number of Hills (1 to 9)
810AC122 0XXX      810AC6C2 0XXX  -  Hill 1 pad
810AC124 0XXX      810AC6C4 0XXX  -  Hill 2 pad

810AC132 0XXX      810AC6D2 0XXX  -  Hill 9 pad

Like respawn points, Hills need to be tested. Use the same pad as the value of
both codes below. Like the respawn tester, this can be changed during gameplay
so you don't need to reload the level to try a different value.

Capture the Case, like King of the Hill, is modified using codes that work in
all levels. Just use the same codes for each level. Capture the Case bases
consist of a case position and 6 respawn points. The respawn points should be
placed as close to the case as possible, but not so close next to one another
that players start appearing in one another. Respawns need to be tested and an
easy way to do this is put all players and 8 sims on the same team. If anyone
dies when the level starts then one of the pads is faulty.

Objects are the hardest to modify. You usually need to change several values in
order to make them the way you want. The type and amount of objects at your
disposal depends on the Mp_Setup thats used. You can either have a level with
lots of doors (using Area 52 or Felicity), or a level with lots of objects
(using Base or Ravine). You want to make the objects in your multiplayer level
as much like they are in the solo mission. To do this you need to reference
what values they have on the solo mission setup for the arena you're doing.

Modifying the object type must be done with great care. When you change the
type you usually end up with an object that doesn't quite work as you expected.
More than just the object type must be modified to get the object you want.
Doors should be left as doors, glass left as glass and lifts left as lifts.
Normal objects like metal crates are the most flexible. Metal crates can be
turned into Hoverbikes or Hovercrates. Turning a metal crate into a Hoverbike
requires four metal crates in a row. I haven't worked out how to modify the
way in which doors open, so you have to take into account that doors might
swing or slide open in the wrong direction.

I won't go into detail about how you modify objects. I've barely scratched the
surface myself in the codes that I've made. Below you will find the object
modifiers from my multiplayer levels, telling you what each code does. You
should be able to figure out how I did certain stuff from the codes below. To
give an example: if you find something you want to do yourself like making an
object moveable, find the difference between the code that makes the object
moveable and the code that modifies the objects pad. Then simply add that
difference to the pad modifier of the object you want to make moveable.
Values vary depending on what you want to do to the object.

The pads file (pointed to from NTSC 8009D04C or PAL 8009D5AC) is located in
different places in the memory of NTSC and PAL. You therefore need to make two
sets of code for NTSC and PAL and put them in part one of the code together
with the level modifier. You shouldn't have to move any pads unless you really
need to. In the object code above from Carrington Villa Rooftop I moved three
pads. The first moves the pad A1 to the centre of the hoverpad, and the CI drop
ship is placed on it. The second moves the pad 4E above 4F and the third moves
the pad 9B above 9C. I also moved pads 4F and 9C up a little bit, and changed
the size of the CI lift. Pads use a format of coordinates that differs from
that used in the real time coordinates list. It is however possible to convert
between the two coordinate systems.

The very first 32bit value you'll come across in the pads file shows the amount
of pads there are in it. Next there will be four other 32bit values that do
nothing we need to know about. After the five 32bit values you'll see a set of
16bit values that are gradually increasing. These are internal pointers within
the pads file to where pad coordinates are located. They start at pad 0. To use
them simply add the 16bit pad pointer to the address from the beginning of the
pads file. To give an example: if the pads file starts at 804F9F50 and the
first 16bit pad pointer is 0488, 804F9F50 + 0488 = 804FA3D8. 804FA3D8 is the
address where information and coordinates about pad 0 is located.

804FA3D8 - 0009 4010 FCF9 0064 02E4 0000

Pad 0 is a navigational pad and has nothing but coordinates defined. The first
two 16bit values define which room the pad can be in. It also does lots of
other stuff that I haven't worked out yet. If you want to move a pad from one
room to another room you need to change this. If you're moving a pad within the
same room (like I did in Carrington Villa Rooftop) this doesn't need to be
changed. If you're using an N64 emulator and make a code that moves a pad
elsewhere in the level without changing this value, don't be fooled. The code
won't work in a Gameshark or Action Replay. FCF9 is the X coordinate, 0064 is
the Y coordinate (up or down) and 02E4 is the Z coordinate. 0000 does something
too (but what indeed?).

To convert the pad coordinates (FCF9 0064 02E4) into real time coordinates you
need a little program called Float Convert:

http://www.gscentral.com/lib/downloads/FloatConvert.zip

This program converts 32bit real time coordinates into decimal numbers and
vice-versa. It doesn't convert them into hexadecimal numbers. Positive
coordinates like 3F800000 and up will become positive decimal numbers, negative
coordinates like BF800000 and up will become negative decimal numbers. The
decimal coordinates then need to be converted to hexadecimal (using Windows
Calculator). Positive pad coordinates are positive hexadecimal values.
Negative pad coordinates are FFFF and down. 0000 is the middle, 0001 is
positive and FFFF is negative. This can all get very confusing so I'll give you
some examples of converting coordinates.

Lets convert the Y coordinate 0064 into a real time coordinate. 64 in decimal
is 100. Putting 100 in Float Convert we get 42C80000. 0064 = 42C80000.

Next lets convert the X coordinate FCF9 into a real time coordinate. First we
need to turn FCF9 into a negative hex number, 10000 - FCF9 = 307 = -307. -307
in decimal is -755. -755 in Float Convert gives C43CC000. FCF9 = C43CC000.

Converting a negative real time coordinate can get confusing. Lets convert
C5675EE4 into a pad coordinate. C5675EE4 in decimal is -3701.93. Discard the
fraction and you get -3701. -3701 in hex is -E74. 10000 - +E74 = F18C.
F18C is roughly equal to C5675EE4.

Real time coordinates are found by using the methods described at the end of
Part Two. The pad modifications that I have made modify navigational pads. This
should be avoided because it messes up the sim navigational routines. Move too
many navigational pads away from an area and the sims will stand on the spot
doing the CanCan. Try and move navigational pads from places sims are unlikely
to go.


Once you've created all the codes you need to put them all together in an
understandable way so that other people can use them. Cheating devices won't
accept more than about 60 lines of code per cheat code, so you need to divide
the final complete code up into parts. Project 64 won't accept more than 100
lines of code per cheat code either. You can't have the Hill codes and Base
codes on at the same time. Likewise, the respawns don't need to be on when the
Bases are turned on because they have their own respawns. We put the respawn
and Hill codes in one part and the Base codes in another. You can then select
between the two before loading the game up. The level modifier and any other
codes that modify just NTSC or PAL are put in part one. Weapons and ammo are
put in part two, objects are put in part three (and four if they're too long),
the respawns and Hills are put in part four and the Bases in part five.

Testing the code:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before releasing your multiplayer level to the public it's a good idea to test
it first. The enablers need to be tested with the final complete code, and the
level needs to be tested on both PC and cheating device to see if all the codes
work as they should. There are some methods of modifying objects that only work
on a PC, and some that only work on a cheating device.

You'll need to test the code in all four formats. If you don't have access to
one or more of them you need to ask someone else who has to do the testing for
you. You don't need four controllers to test up to four players. You can pull
controllers in and out of their sockets to control each player independently.

Perfect Dark puts the in-game level data rather randomly in the memory, and it
takes very little to knock it out of place so that the enablers no longer work.
To test the enablers activate the enabler for the format you're testing, part
one (level modifier) and part two (weapons and ammo). These parts are bound to
work in all formats. Don't activate the objects, respawns, Hills or Bases just
yet. Once the enabler, part one and part two are activated run Perfect Dark and
go straight to the Advanced Menu in the Combat Simulator. Select your level
from the arena menu. Press L+R if the enabler requires it. Load the level with
one player and quit. Back at the menu press L if the enabler requires it. Load
the level again with one player and quit. If everything worked up until now,
and you found the weapons and ammo in the places you put them, then one player
works and you should be able to keep loading it without the game freezing. If
you're using an N64 emulator create a savestate at this stage. Two player,
three player and four player are meant to work after one player has been
loaded. Load two player (waiting for the two menus to appear for a second or
two) and quit. Two player works as well if you found the weapons and ammo. At
this stage do not activate a third player and test three players. Three player
is meant to work after one player, not two player. Either load that savestate
you created earlier, or deactivate the second player and load one player once
(remembering to press L before entering the level if the enabler requires it).
After one player load three player to see if it works. Repeat the process for
four player. If all player amount modes have worked so far you can start
switching between different amounts and testing the level after two, three and
four player. If you can switch between player amount modes without the game
freezing the enabler works perfectly.

If you encounter the game freezing while trying a player amount mode after the
stable one player mode, the enabler needs to be modified. The game is putting
the in-game level data elsewhere than it should. It shouldn't be far off
though. It can be something like +10 off. It will always be in the 10's off.
If you're using an N64 emulator you can make a savestate to find out how much
the memory deviates from where it should be. If you're using a cheating device
you need to test the enabler by trial and error. To give an example: say the
value that modifies the in-game level data placement is 2780 for two player
mode. If two player mode doesn't work try 2790 or 2770 instead. Keep
increasing or decreasing the value until two player works. You shouldn't have
to go further than +-100. If the player amount mode still isn't working, and
if the soundtrack is playing but the level isn't loading, you've made a
mistake in the weapons and ammo moving codes (part two).

Once you've got the enablers working in both a PC and cheating device
(whatever format) you can test the entire multiplayer code. Activate all parts
except five or six (depending on the scenario you want to play). If the game
freezes then there is most likely a mistake in the object codes. This usually
happens if you have changed the object type of any objects. Turning a door into
an object tends to make the game freeze a lot. Stick to using the value 000A
(which should work in both PC and cheating device).

Instructions on how to use the enabler must be made for each format. Add any
information about not being able to switch between various player amount modes
here. As long as all modes work after the stable one player mode you don't
need to fiddle with the enabler. Switching between player amounts isn't that
important.


When I tested Skedar Ruins in multiplayer all the enablers worked. I did
however come across a problem in the PAL PC version. I couldn't switch from
three players to two players. I also made a mistake in the code that changes
the fifth door into a pillar. I originally used object type 36 to turn the
door into an object. While this worked in an emulator it didn't work in a
cheating device and needed to be changed to 0A.

The following section contains codes for fully working modified levels, and
some cool extra codes as well.


Fully working multiplayer levels:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Crash Site Caves / Crash Site Racing Ground:
--------------------------------------------
Since Crash Site is such a big arena I managed to place two fundamentally
different multiplayer levels into it. Crash Site Caves takes place in the
middle area of the arena, in the big and small caves. It resembles the original
multiplayer levels in that you have multiple routes of going from one place to
another. The areas that you're not supposed to go to are blocked off by UFO's
and Presidential escape capsules. Crash Site Racing Ground takes place in the
area where you start the solo mission, and the area around the front end of the
crashed Air Force One. This version of Crash Site has four hoverbikes in it
(hence the name Racing Ground), and is also an excellent level for sniping
(something that none of the other original levels offer much of).

Both Crash Site in multiplayer levels have been optimalised so that they are
accessed in the same way, using the same player amount enablers. They can also
both be played by people that only have a version 3.0 cheating device (the
codes are under 79 lines of code). The only exception is that Crash Site Racing
Ground has a few extra codes that can only be activated by version 3.3 users or
PC users (this doesn't make the game play experience any better, it just adds
more weapon points). The PC versions have been tested and work in Project 64.
There are two versions of the NTSC enablers. If you don't know which version
you have you just have to try by trial and error the two enablers.

How to use both codes:
----------------------
Input the code in four different parts. Part one and two should always be on.
If you want to play in any scenario other than Capture the Case activate part
three (but not part four). If you want to play only Capture the Case, activate
part four (but not part three). Both Crash Site Caves and Crash Site Racing
Ground work in the same way. To get the codes working with different player
amounts you have to use an enabler. In total you should have activated four
different codes: part one and two, Part three or four, and an enabler. Only
activate either the Caves version or the Racing Ground version, you can't
activate them both at the same time. If your cheating device version is below
3.3, don't activate any other codes (except the must be on enabler).

Once all the correct codes have been input, start the game and go straight to
the Combat Simulator Advanced menu. From here follow the instructions that go
with the enabler. Don't try and play in any arenas other than Crash Site. Once
the code is working you can exit and enter the level as many times as you wish.

Carrington Villa Residence / Carrington Villa Rooftop:
------------------------------------------------------
Carrington Villa is one of the best solo levels in the game, and it also
doubles as a great multiplayer level as well. Like with Crash Site, I have
chosen to make two different multiplayer levels for Carrington Villa. The first
level is called Carrington Villa Residence and takes place inside the actual
building. This version just has doors and windows and is made to run at the
best framerate possible. The second level is called Carrington Villa Rooftop,
and allows you to walk around on the roof and some of the outside areas. It
also has lots of objects inside the building, like sofas and tables to hide
behind. Since you have such a good view of the entire level from the rooftop,
this version can lag quite a bit sometimes. If you intend to play with three or
four players and lots of sims, the best level to play in is Carrington Villa
Residence. You can also lock the doors leading out into the empty parts of both
levels.

Both Carrington Villa Residence and Carrington Villa Rooftop work in the same
way. To get the codes working with different player amounts you have to use an
enabler. Both codes are longer than 78 lines of code, so you can only play in
the levels if you have a version 3.3 Professional cheating device. You will
need to activate the following hirez enabler if you run these codes in a
cheating device:

NTSC
FF72C5A0 0000
PAL
FF730000 0000

Make sure any other enablers are off. The PC version enablers have been tested
and work in Project 64. There are two versions of the NTSC enablers. If you
don't know which version you have you just have to try by trial and error the
two enablers.

How to get both codes working:
------------------------------
Enter the code into your cheating device in six different parts. Parts one, two
and three should always be on when you run the code. In Villa Residence part
four is optional, if you want to lock the doors leading to the empty parts of
the level turn it on. The sims shouldn't try to go to the empty parts even if
the doors are unlocked (unless you give them a good reason, like if you're
holding the briefcase). Part four of Villa Rooftop should always be on. If you
want to play in any scenario BUT Capture the Case, turn part five on, and leave
part six off. If you want to play in just Capture the Case, turn part six on,
and leave part five off.

You also need to activate an enabler which gets the level working. Make sure
you follow the enabler instuctions correctly or the game will freeze. Once the
code is working you can exit and enter the level as many times as you wish.

Instructions:
Go straight to the Advanced Combat Simulator menu. Select Crash Site with one
player but before entering the level press and hold L+R for a few seconds. When
letting go make sure you pull your finger off L before R. Load the level and
quit as soon as possible. Back at the Advanced Menu press and hold L for a few
seconds. Load Crash Site with one player again and quit. The code should work
from then on. You can turn on the amount of players you want to play with. You
can also switch between different player amounts. When switching back to one
player mode you have to press L before loading the level. Allow time for each
players independent multiplayer menu to appear before loading the level. Don't
quickly add/remove another player and start the game before his menu has time
to appear/disappear. Don't use the drop out function.

Skedar Ruins:
-------------
I created Skedar Ruins at the same time as writing about multiplayer level
modding. I chose to make a level full of objects rather than doors. You'll see
almost all the objects seen in the solo mission, but you'll only find two sets
of doors. I placed the Buddy bridge over the canyon (as seen in Co-Operative
mode) and the sims have no problems in passing over it. Two of the Bases are
where the Maian leader and third Skedar King are in WAR!, so you can relive
WAR! by playing Capture the Case. The PC versions have been tested and work in
Project 64. This is a version 3.3 cheating device only code. There are two
versions of the NTSC enablers. If you don't know which version you have you
just have to try by trial and error the two enablers.

How to use the code:
--------------------
Input the code in six different parts. Part one, two, three and four should
always be on. If you want to play in any scenario other than Capture the Case
activate part five (but not part six). If you want to play only Capture the
Case, activate part six (but not part five). To get the codes working with
different player amounts you have to use an enabler. In total you should have
activated six different codes: part one, two, three and four, part five or six,
and an enabler.

Once all the correct codes have been input, start the game and go straight to
the Combat Simulator Advanced menu. From here follow the instructions that go
with the enabler. Don't try and play in any arenas other than Skedar Ruins.
Once the code is working you can exit and enter the level as many times as you
wish.

Go straight to the Advanced Combat Simulator menu. Select Crash Site with one
player but before entering the level press and hold L+R for a few seconds. When
letting go make sure you pull your finger off L before R. Load the level and
quit as soon as possible. Back at the Advanced Menu press and hold L for a few
seconds. Load Crash Site with one player again and quit. The code should work
from then on. You can turn on the amount of players you want to play with. You
can also switch between different player amounts. When switching back to one
player mode you have to press L before loading the level. Allow time for each
players independent multiplayer menu to appear before loading the level. Don't
quickly add/remove another player and start the game before his menu has time
to appear/disappear. Don't use the drop out function.

Fully working solo missions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Crash Site in Carrington Villa:
-------------------------------
To get this code working, go to the Solo Mission menu and select Crash Site in
either Perfect Agent or Perfect Dark Agent mode. Once the cut-scene starts,
press L and R at the same time. If you want to restart the level, go back to
the empty level and walk off the edge, then repeat the process. This code will
work in all versions of cheating devices. The PC versions work in Project 64.
It should be possible to complete this level, the Skedar shuttle has been
moved into the level and changed into a different object.

WAR! in Deep Sea:
-----------------
Breifing:

The true conspiracy has finally been revealed! Using a modified version of the
Ceten teleports, a Carrington Institute S.W.A.T team has infiltrated the Ceten
battleship. It would seem that part of the ship survived the explosion, and
that the CI are there to retrieve data on the Ceten Megaweapon. Join a team of
Maian soldiers and put a stop to their evil plans.

Objective One: Complete objective two before objective three

Objective Two: Eliminate Elvis

This human-loving traitor has allied himself with the humans. He is in control
of the Carrington Institute troops that are swarming the Ceten ship. It is
therefore imperative that you eliminate him as fast as possible.

Objective Three: Assassinate Daniel Carrington

Daniel Carrington is currently retrieving the data on the Ceten Megaweapon. He
knows too much and must be silenced. Unfortunately, Carrington has got hold of
one of those mass-spawning-clone machines of the Skedar. He's currently using
it to spawn an army of Perfect Dark's, the Carrington Institute's best agent.
Expect heavy resistance.

END

To get this code working, simply choose WAR! on either the Perfect Agent, or
Perfect Dark Agent difficulty, from the Solo Missions menu. Once the cutscene
starts, press L and R. If you've got a Gameshark version 3.0, then don't
activate any other codes while using this one. This level might be a bit
difficult, so you'll want to adjust the settings in Perfect Dark Agent Mode.
You can change the costumes, weapons and soundtrack. If you remove the costumes
and weapons you end up with Skedar, like in WAR!. Costumes can be changed by
using the values on the costume list, weapons can be changes by using the
weapon type list and the in-game object list (see resources section). The PC
versions have been tested and work in Project 64.

Pelagic II in Carrington Villa:
-------------------------------
Maian terrorists have invaded Carrington's Villa! In order to stop this alien
invasion you need to eliminate all of them. Reconnesiance reveals that the
Maians have made a stonghold in the lower basement where they are testing a new
kind of time manipulative device, resulting in what can only be described as
real time lag. Avoid meeting too many Maians at once. Time could slow so much
down that they overwhelm you!

This code will work a few seconds after the small Rareware logo at the bottom
of the screen turns up. The aim of the mission is to kill as many Maians as
possible! If you die simply press A a few times to restart. Don't press B at
the objectives menu. The only value that you can change is the one for the last
code on the list. This is the difficulty mod, so set this to 0 for Agent, 1 for
Special Agent and 2 for Perfect Agent (which is extremely hard).

Real Skedar in multiplayer:
---------------------------
They run like Skedar, they roar like Skedar and they die like Skedar!

The following codes change the ShockTrooper character into Skedar, and change
the human animations seen in multiplayer into Skedar animations. To get this
code working set all the sim characters to ShockTrooper, with ShockTrooper
helmets. Exit the character select menu and hold down L for a few seconds.
Unfortunately, you can't play as a Skedar, so make sure none of the human
players are using the ShockTrooper costume. Once you've pressed L, don't enter
the character costume menu again.

Replace the XX on line four with:
5C - Skedar
7B - Mini Skedar
93 - Skedar King

If you want to play with a selection of different Skedar types, use these
additional codes. These codes use the same values as above. To give an example,
if you want to play with Skedar and Skedar Kings at the same time, set the main
code as Skedar (5C), and the dataDyne Sniper code as Skedar King (93). When you
select character costumes for the sims, set all Skedar to the ShockTrooper
costume, and all Skedar Kings to the dataDyne Sniper costume (with the correct
masks):

This code has one major flaw. The human player animations have been changed
into Skedar animations, which means that all the human players that are using
human bodies will look weird. They will be flying in the air with their legs
and arms sticking out! This code works best with just one player (because you
can't see yourself). Several minor flaws result from the fact that the Skedar
animations were never meant to be used in multiplayer. When the Skedar run
their guns will point downward, but they will still shoot in the right
direction. Another flaw is the fact that there is no Skedar bent down
animation. I used a BETA halting Skedar animation that has the Skedar look like
it's bent down, but they jump up and down. Don't play with the sims in
Warehouse because the Skedar sims jump out of the level in the small air ducts.

I changed the "sim standing still with no guns" animation into the BETA Skedar
Scratching His Left Ear animation, because it's cute to watch.


GoldenEye Weapons in Multiplayer:
---------------------------------
These codes change Perfect Darks weapons into GoldenEye's weapons, and allow
you to use them in multiplayer. The codes are a mixture of codes that I have
hacked myself, and codes that I got from SquareGuru's PD weapons FAQ on
gamefaqs.com. There's a code for each weapon, so you can choose which GE
weapons to activate. There are also different versions of some of the codes. If
you want to play with a specific Perfect Dark weapon at the same time as a
GoldenEye weapon, you can choose between several weapons to change into that
GoldenEye weapon. To get the best results use the first eight codes, these give
you all eight GE weapons. They will be in the correct order, and the sims will
use them correctly according to how powerful each weapon is. The PAL versions
are slightly longer because they change the name of the weapon to it's PAL name
(like PP9i to PP7). Some of the guns have an extra code that only lets players
pick up one gun (by default you will be able to get double). These codes aren't
just limited to multiplayer, they work perfectly in the solo mission. To give
an example, Falcon 2 to PP91 (PP7) gives you a PP91 (PP7) at the start of
Investigation.

Costume list:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The costume list contains the heads and bodies used for enemies and players.
These values are used in-game in a body+head 16bit format. To give an example,
Cassandra's head is 0E, and her body is 66. To locate Cassandra de Vries
in-game do a search for 660E. Some bodies can't have heads put on them, and
can't be used as player bodies (but can be used as sim bodies). These bodies
are Skedar, Dr. Caroll, Camspy, Test body, G5 Sentry Robot, Mini Skedar and
Skedar King. The head value of these bodies is FF, so the Skedar King would be
93FF. FF is also random heads. Part of the costume list is located at NTSC
8007CF06 and PAL 8007D3D6. The list at this address uses the costume values
from the global object list. By modifying the values here you change a costume
image throughout the game (with the exception of during cut-scenes).

Text lists:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Almost all the text in the game is stored in the text files with the format
LxxxE, found on the global object list. These text files contains sets of text
strings that are used either in solo missions, or in the menus. Not all text
files have text. The text files can be arranged in a list in such a way that
you can easily see what their text string values will begin with.

Values - File name - Text Value - Text Type

The text from a specific text file can only be used when it has been loaded
into the memory. The menu's text files are always loaded into the memory, so
their text strings always work. Solo mission text files are loaded into the
memory when a solo level is loaded. The following code can be used to view any
text string, providing you select the correct solo mission from the Solo
Mission menu.

Text string viewer: (Viewed in any briefing)
NTSC               PAL
8109DFC8 XXXX      8109E568 XXXX

The text string values are mainly used to locate menu codes and view BETA text.
They can also be used to locate certain menu lists, like the multiplayer arena
list, or soundtrack list. These lists can be modified so that you can change
what's loaded, and the name of what's loaded. A compilation of all BETA text
can be found at the end of the text string lists. An example of a modified
arena from the arena list is:

Random Arena Modifier:
NTSC               PAL
80084BF9 00LL      80085149 00LL
81084BFC XXXX      8108514C XXXX

LL is a value from the level list, and changes which level is loaded. XXXX
changes the name "Random" into something else. Several names you may want to
choose from are:

5687  dataDyne Research
5689  dataDyne Central
568B  Carrington Villa
568D  Chicago
568F  G5 Building
5691  Area 51
5697  Air Base
5699  Air Force One
569B  Crash Site
569D  Pelagic II
569F  Deep Sea
56A1  Carrington Institute
56A3  Attack Ship
56A5  Skedar Ruins

The PAL and the NTSC version are almost the same, but have some different text
string values. Where they have different values you will see two values next to
each other. The first one is NTSC and the second one is PAL.

0A28  How are you feeling, Mr. President?
0A29  Better now, young lady. Today, I think, will take a while for me to get
       over. I can't believe Easton would do such a thing. I knew he was
       ambitious, yes, but this
0A2A  Just one thing, sir? What is the Pelagic II that Trent wanted so badly?
0A2B  It's a U.S. government deep sea research vessel, one of a kind. The only
       ship that can conduct a full-scale diving operation at extreme depth.
       Trent wanted me to loan it to the dataDyne Corporation, but I refused

0E38  Excellent, Joanna. That cable car is your way in... Our observer at the
       lower terminus has spotted a member of the flight crew boarding a minute
       ago. She is being escorted by air base troops. I don't have to remind
       you that...
0E39  That they're probably innocent of any involvement in Trent's little
       scheme. And I can't shoot them even if they shoot at me. What about the
       NSA Agents?
0E3A  I don't know how far the conspiracy has spread through the NSA, but I'm
       willing to bet that the men Trent has around him here are loyal to him
       and his plan. You have to get the evidence of Trent's betrayal onto Air
       Force One and show it to the President
0E3B  Yes, and protect him from his abductors. Do you have any idea what
       Trent's plan might be yet, and what about those blonde guys?
0E3C  Only vague suspicions, and I won't distract you with those. Good luck.

1848  We've recovered the sapient from Carrington .and altered its
       programming. It no longer .has a personality, so there will be no
       .further incidents
1849  This will reduce its efficiency. My team will .have to take it to the
       core themselves. This .will endanger them. You should have .anticipated
       that the sapient might develop .a troublesome moral code
184A  No one could have predicted that! And I .resent being singled out for
       blame! .What about him?
184B  The President turned down your request for .the loan of the Pelagic
       II?.....Could it be you overestimated your .influence over him?
184C  No! Perhaps I underestimated his resolve. .We have a contingency plan
       ready to go, .and we will move as soon as the Presidential .entourage
       arrives at the air base. All I .need from the President is a tissue
       sample
184D  Ha! Assuming you don't get any interference. .If Carrington has pieced
       together enough of .this, he will have called for reinforcements
184E  There will be no outside help for .Mr. Carrington. The technology you
       gave us .is installed in Nevada and fully operational. .We can intercept
       any craft they use
184F  Then the devices we gave you are working .correctly? Good. Because we
       believe .anything which does not work correctly .should be destroyed.
       Consider that as you .follow your 'backup plans.'
1850  Agent Dark reporting in! Prepare to .receive a download of the meeting
       data. .Priority request for an Institute Support .Team to protect the
       President before he .goes to Alaska.
1851  No time for that now, Agent Dark. There's .been a development during
       radio silence. .The craft carrying those 'friends' I was .talking about
       was shot down over Nevada. .The weapon responsible was fired from .Area
       51... that's where the survivors and .debris will have been taken.
       You're to .prep for immediate dispatch when you .return here. Carrington
       out
1852  Area 51? But what about the President?

590B  1CAD  dataDyne Corporation
590C  1CAE  The monolithic corporation that dataDyne has become started off
              as an AI systems programming business. When it became apparent
              that much of their income came from their work as a defense
              contractor for the U.S. military, a young and forward-looking
              manager called Cassandra De Vries started pushing for deals with
              weapons manufacturers, while ignoring offers from Daniel
              Carrington and the Institute for collaboration on quantum
              computing and AI research. After the third armament company was
              bought by dataDyne, profits became astronomical. Within a month
              of the receipt of a government contract for weapons development,
              Cassandra De Vries was CEO. A significant portion of
              corporation profits were redirected into AI research, with
              excellent results
590D  1CAF  Carrington Institute
590E  1CB0  Briefly dismissed as a crackpot inventor, Daniel Carrington was
              the first to release anti-gravity technology to the world.
              Revenues from this and related development helped set up the
              Carrington Institute, ostensibly a technology think tank situated
              in a remote part of the continental U.S. In actual fact, the
              Institute is also a training ground for agents who are sent
              out into the world to keep track of technological development
              around the globe, for reasons best known to Daniel Carrington
              himself

2026  Those hackers have to be stopped before .I rescue Daniel
2027  Agent Dark Mission Log, 1846 hours. Last .night we got a call from
       Cassandra de Vries. .A dataDyne team have taken Daniel Carrington
       .hostage at his private villa on the coast, .and they say they will
       spare his life in .exchange for the AI.
2028  Unfortunately, we don't have it. Daniel and .Dr. Caroll were at the
       villa to discuss .'matters of mutual interest.' It looks .like Daniel
       found a way to hide Dr. Caroll .inside the villa when the dataDyne hit
       .squad arrived
2029  Hopefully our phoney negotiator ploy will .give me a chance to surprise
       the dataDyne .squad. This time it's not just my life .on the line
202A  Sir? Are you injured?
202B  No, Joanna, I'm okay, but those dataDyne .thugs made me tell them where
       I'd hidden .Dr. Caroll. If only I'd held out for a .few minutes more
202C  It's not your fault, sir. I should have .been quicker
202D  Don't blame yourself, Joanna. Dr. Caroll .told me that he expected this
       to happen. .Actually, when they recaptured him, the .dataDyne team got
       overconfident and let .slip a few facts when they thought I was
       .unconscious. They mentioned a meeting in .the G5 Building in Chicago,
       Illinois, .tonight. I want you to be there, but that .doesn't leave you
       a lot of time to get .ready
202E  That won't be a problem, sir. So, did .Dr. Caroll have any useful
       information .for you?
202F  Oh, yes, indeed. He certainly did, and .I'll brief you when you're en
       route to .Chicago. We might still be able to help .him, even after those
       butchers remove his .personality. He thinks they'll keep a .copy of it
       in a safe place. It's about .time I called in some friends to deal .with

222B  But you know how it is, Joanna... I had to make sure my hair was just
       right, and then there was the suit.
222C  They should keep you away from mirrors. Nervous?
222D  Very. I've waited for this moment for so many years. Contact, friendly
       contact, between Humans and Maians is what the Institute was founded

3020  No signs of conflict. No spent ammo cases or bullet holes
3021  But there ought to be a rear guard at least. It makes no sense
3022  There has to be someone farther inside. Cover me
3023  Here goes. I just hope dataDyne haven't done anything to prevent this

       aaAhh!! *** oOOoh!! *** aAArRrgghh!! *** YEEeeooOOOOOOowWWwlll!! ***
3027  Dr. Caroll? Are you in control again? Can you stop the program?
3028  Yes, I'm back again, my dear. But the program has run far too long for
       me to prevent it from completing. There is only one way out now
3029  What do you mean?
302A  When the program has run, I will have control of a vastly powerful
       weapon. It cannot be allowed to exist. So I must destroy the Cetan and,
       unfortunately, myself along with it. I'm sorry, Joanna... There is no
       other way and no time to discuss this. Go now - avoid the Skedar and you
       will have time to escape. It has been an honor to work with you.
       Goodbye, Joanna Dark

364B  But this is a golden opportunity to show that America has faith in its

4220  OH, NO!!! A Skedar army in suspended animation!
4221  Okay, this is it... Cut off the head and the .body will perish
4222  This is the Skedar fanatics' most holy place. They believe this planet
       is sacred ground. The Battle Shrine is located at the most holy part of
       this holy planet
4223  So let me get this straight - it's holy. But there's more to it than
       that, isn't there?
4224  Yes. In all of the time that we Maians fought the Skedar, we never found
       this place. We knew that until it was destroyed, the war would never be
       over. We fought the Skedar to a standstill, we earned a ceasefire - but
       we always had to be on our guard. The destruction of this place would
       mean a chance at true peace
4225  Then we have to be certain that no fanatics survive. I'll go in and take
       out the leader. You'll have to summon the Maian fleet to level the
       Shrine
4226  If you're caught on the ground when the fleet gets here, you won't stand
       a chance
4227  That's a mistake I don't intend to make
4228  Yesss

       top secret base, and now I'm stealing his alien.

-------
4830  It's dangerous, Jo
4831  I can handle it... Trust me
4832  Okay

A last minute conversation where Jonathan tries to talk you out of the most fun
part of the level. Escaping on the hoverbike! (Or jetbike as Joanna likes to
call it in 483A)

4834  I'll cover the stairs - you take the ramp

There are no stairs in Area 51.

483E  I'm not having this. That specimen is government property and should not
       leave the base.
4842  Please stop! I'm not supposed to die. She Arggghhh!

Text from a BETA item that identified what it was pointed at?


PerfectHead:

Carrington Institute:
---------------------
590B  1CAD  dataDyne Corporation
590C  1CAE  The monolithic corporation that dataDyne has become started off
              as an AI systems programming business. When it became apparent
              that much of their income came from their work as a defense
              contractor for the U.S. military, a young and forward-looking
              manager called Cassandra De Vries started pushing for deals with
              weapons manufacturers, while ignoring offers from Daniel
              Carrington and the Institute for collaboration on quantum
              computing and AI research. After the third armament company was
              bought by dataDyne, profits became astronomical. Within a month
              of the receipt of a government contract for weapons development,
              Cassandra De Vries was CEO. A significant portion of
              corporation profits were redirected into AI research, with
              excellent results
590D  1CAF  Carrington Institute
590E  1CB0  Briefly dismissed as a crackpot inventor, Daniel Carrington was
              the first to release anti-gravity technology to the world.
              Revenues from this and related development helped set up the
              Carrington Institute, ostensibly a technology think tank situated
              in a remote part of the continental U.S. In actual fact, the
              Institute is also a training ground for agents who are sent
              out into the world to keep track of technological development
              around the globe, for reasons best known to Daniel Carrington
              himself

BETA text from the Info menu in the Information lab.

5996  1D38  This Maian grenade plays havoc with the neurons in sentient
              creatures. If you wander into the blast radius, your vision will
              blur and you will lose your grip on whatever you're holding. The
              grenade can be set to go off on impact or by proximity trigger.
              Make sure you throw it far enough away

A BETA description of the N-Bomb from the firing range.

1C74  PP7
1C75  TT33
1C76  Skorpion
1C77  AK47
1C78  Uzi 9mm
1C79  MP5K
1C7A  M-16
1C7B  FNP90

The BETA names of weapons from GoldenEye.

1C2F  You're meant to use the Disguise, remember?
1C2C  Go away, Joanna. You're not fooling anybody!

Two BETA messages you dont hear.


Challenge Descriptions:
-----------------------
Challenge 8   Capture the flag in the Skedar arena with the SuperDragon
Challenge 10  Touch that box in the complex. Fight against a team of simulants
               for control of the boxes. Touch a box to claim it for your own
               team.
Challenge 11  King of the hill in the temple with drug guns
Challenge 13  1 hit kills, touch that box, g5, with drug guns
Challenge 14  Capture the flag in area 52 with cloaking
Challenge 15  Capture the briefcase in the Matrix with devastators
Challenge 21  Touch the boxes to claim them for your side. The Cloaking Device
               is available
Challenge 27  A touch the box game featuring rocket launchers and expert
               opponents
Challenge 28  A capture the flag game with no shields and expert opponents

The Challenge Descriptions are not shown in the RAM. They are in the actual ROM
image of the game. There are both BETA descriptions and the final descriptions.
These are the most notable BETA descriptions. Capture the Flag is actually
Capture the Case. Matrix is a BETA level. The level was designed to look like
the area from the Matrix movie where Neo & Co infiltrate a building. The levels
walls were at one point the same colour as the walls in the area from the
Matrix. In the final version they changed the wall textures and the name of the
level to Grid.


Usernames / Passwords:
----------------------
Although the username and password you get when you have a Perfect Player is
Entropicdecay / Zero-tau, on closer inspection it is actually:

EnTROpIcDeCAy / ZeRo-Tau

Notice the different capital and small letters. Could this shed any more light
on what the username / password is actually used for?

Cassandra's Necklace username / password is:

CDV780322 / I8MOZYM8NDI85
